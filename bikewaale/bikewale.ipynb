      "I want to sell my bike because I have already 2 more two-wheelers that's why the bike's condition is very good only 10700 km driven. I am the first owner of the bike. The bike is very comfortable for driving in the city and on highways.

      "Avenger cruise 220 is one of a kind cruiser in India. I personally has always been a fan of low height bike for cruising due to which I chose avenger to be my first bike in Feb., 2021 and bought it from local dealer taking delivery on the same day. Since then, it is used as a daily commute vehicle for a daily travel (on highway road) of 75 kms with an average mileage of 50 kmpl. Achieving this mileage requires quite a lot of pampering to bike like lubricating the chain every 500 kms, cleaning air filter every 1000kms and a weekly wash. It has a 220cc engine which is considered all good when compared to Royal Enfield bikes but the pick up gets compensated due to its lesser weight of 165 kg.As reported by others it does ride smoothly until you reach the speed of 75 kmph. After that the body starts vibrating making it feel like you are forcing the engine however, I've touched the speed of 104 kmph on the same vehicle. The bike has a digital meter which has a bluish backlight that turns on with headlight. During daytime since the headlight if off, there is no backlight in digital meter which sometimes makes it difficult to read the meter while riding. In my opinion since the meter is digital, the company could have also provided gear indicator in it. The first service was done after one month from the date of purchase. After completing a few kilometers following 1st service the virtual display started showing engine malfunction light due to which i took it to service center as recommended by user manual provided with vehicle. The service center deleted the error code using bosch toolkit and assured me that the problem is solved. However, the same error popped while riding, compelling me to take it to service center again. To solve this, they changed the o2 sensor in my 3rd visit to service center which proved to be a temporary solution. I informed the center about the reoccurring problem and they told me that the ecu of vehicle will be changed (after a wait of 15 days). Hence, in my 4th visit the ecu changed and engine malfunction light was gone.For a while (after 2nd service on my 5th visit to service center) the bike rode smooth as a geisel until it stopped suddenly at a speed of 70kmph on highway with heavy traffic volume during peak rush hours leaving me stranded. Before buying this vehicle, i did a lot of research on its bs6 model which helped me self-diagnosing the cause of problem. It was found that the side stand sensor fell off (the bolt provided in side stand sensor is very short due to which the nut got loosened with time and fell off) while riding which made it impossible for bike to run (refer function of side stand sensor in bike). I had to hire a tempo to transport my bike (metaphorically a dead fish in water) to service centre (6th visit). It took about 15 days (again) for the service center to solve the problem as they didn’t have this part too in stock during which the bike stayed at centre.After riding for 2 weeks from receiving my bike the engine malfunction light popped up again. I again informed the service center and they asked me that the wiring need to be replaced which was also out of stock and I had to wait for 15 days. As the time of truth came (7th visit), the wiring was replaced with new one which proved to be a fruitless solution compelling the mechanics to again replace the wiring with old one. Ironically, replacing the new wiring with old one did the trick.The 3rd service (8th visit) was done in the month of November before 10,000 kms following which the engine malfunction light again showed up decreasing the average mileage of vehicle. This time it was found that the throttle body need to be cleaned (9th visit) and so they did.Overall, apart from so much inconvenience caused by some design flaws of bike I like riding avenger cruise 220.Rating Parameters(out of 5)4Visual Appeal1Reliability4Performance5Comfort3Service ExperienceAbout the ReviewerUsed it forDaily CommuteOwned for6 months-1 yrRidden for10000-15000 kmsRead More\n",
      "Looks: totally subjective. Wish a more beefy fuel tank.Buying experience: average. Riding: very comfortable, i must say, on of the most comfortable seats in this price range. Seat is broad and well curved for support and movement. But pillion seat could have been more wider. Pillion comfort is not very good like rider comfort. the part i want to talk about is gearing, well.... I dont like the gearbox. Its okay, but not like yamaha or suzuki gearboxes. Shifting doesn't have that feel and accuracy. Very short gearing ratios, becomes cumbersome in city traffics, for example, 1st gear upto 10 to 15kmph, 2nd gear 15 to 25kmph, 3rd gear 20 to 35 kmph, 4th gear 30 to 50,55kmph, 5th is beyond 55kmph. So needs very frequent gear changing in city. Its not like gixer 250 where 3 rd gear is all u need in city.. If gear shifting is not done properly, bike doesnt pull and engine starts knocking. Simply, in city, you will be busy with gearbox. So city riding is bad in this bike with traffic. Also every gearing has sweet spot where there is minimal vibrations.During highway speeds, vibrations come beyond 70 to 80kmph. Upto 65 kmph, it gives smooth ride. So, if you are enthusiast and love to rev the engine this is not the bike. Go for gixer 250 or duke 200,250. Its a cruiser bike and it is for those who love highway relaxed cruising. But if we compare it to royal enfield classic 350 or thunderbird 350, avenger 220 is much more smooth engine. No vibrations on mirrors upto 80 to 90kmph. Servicing cost is cheap. Takes almost 600 to 700 rs for one service. Fuel economy is okay. Depends on how u ride the bike, gives best economy when, 55 to 65 kmph at 5th gear and 35 to 40kmph at 4th gear... Gives upto 32 to 35kmpl if ridden carefully. Don't rev hard and brake aggressively if u want more mileage. One very bad thing is bajaj did not provide rpm meter in avenger, but pulsars have rpm meter. Always try to ride below 4000rpm to get relaxed ride. I achieved 120kmph top speed, frankly it should not be done. I thik, upto 80 to 90 kmph speed is safe and adequate.Quality of parts are not good, well its cheap in price also compared to duke 200,250 nd gixer250. Many parts tend to get rust in rainy season.I have faced one gross issue with this bike, battery went down and i had to replace it with a new exide 9v solid state battery of 2000rs, at that time, lockdown was going on, so did not get any customer support. See, my bike is only 8 months old, and this battery issue is not expected from a bike of this price. I have also heard about battery issues of avenger from other guys in fb group. Replacing it with new battery has resolved all problems but this should not have occurred in first place within one year of buying.Headlights are decent and looks badass from distance.I recommend if u want to go for it, then take street bcs street 220 gives tubeless tyres. But cruise 220 gives more raised handlebar and upright posture.In mountains, best is 2nd and 3rd gears to pull this bike uphill.Pros: very comfortable, relaxed, big bike feeling and minimum vibration(compared to enfield bikes), also low seat height is good for short riders and novice riders, long seats help during bag packing in back seat.Cons: long base, so handling is not great in traffic, narrow streets and bad roads, cornering is not confidence inspiring, brakes are average and low end torque is not good.Verdict: its a bike for mature riders who loves comfortable speed highway cruising and touring, not a good performer in bad roads but absolutely gem in highways. Wish it would be available with dominar 400 engine and premium components.Rating Parameters(out of 5)3Visual Appeal4Reliability3Performance4Comfort3Service ExperienceAbout the ReviewerUsed it forEverythingOwned for6 months-1 yrRidden for5000-10000 kmsRead More\n",

      "Bajaj has one of the smoothest purchase process. Cheap and quality parts and good after sale service. As far as the gear box is concerned, i wish they rectify the issue, it is very hard and unpredictable. The stock battery will give one a lots of headache. Once to change it there will be no issue. Rear stock tyre grips less on wet roads so, be careful.

      "I bought avenger 220 cruise in December 2020 and I am amazed to see its performance.I heard about that this bike is only for long route but believe me I am riding form past 1.5 years, I found no such issue, yes its turning radius is bit more as compare to other but it hardly troubles.Best part :1) unmatched comfort.( I ride 325 km in a single day but didn't feel like)2) average is around 35 to 40 km/l  in city and 45 km/l on highway. (what else you expect from 220cc engine)3 ) low maintenance.  4) vibrations are very less, it starts above 95 (though less)5) chrome work that provides a stunning look to the bike stunning.6) blue light in digital console meter makes the bike unique from others.Improvements requires (in my view):1) there is no tubeless tyre, although I didn't  find any difficulty till now but yes if company will provide this in future, it will like cherry on the cake.2) pillion seat is not much comfortable, less space provided for pillion rider.3) company should provide double channel abs, right now this bike is having single channel abs.At the last I would recommend this bike as I have a pleasant experience & moreover the price range is very good although some improvements are required which I have mentioned above but still this bike is value for money and no one is going to disappoint after riding this powerful bike.Rating Parameters(out of 5)4Visual Appeal5Reliability4Performance5Comfort4Service ExperienceAbout the ReviewerUsed it forDaily CommuteOwned for> 1 yrRidden for10000-15000 kmsRead More\n",

      "Looks: totally subjective. Wish a more beefy fuel tank.Buying experience: average. Riding: very comfortable, i must say, on of the most comfortable seats in this price range. Seat is broad and well curved for support and movement. But pillion seat could have been more wider. Pillion comfort is not very good like rider comfort. the part i want to talk about is gearing, well.... I dont like the gearbox. Its okay, but not like yamaha or suzuki gearboxes. Shifting doesn't have that feel and accuracy. Very short gearing ratios, becomes cumbersome in city traffics, for example, 1st gear upto 10 to 15kmph, 2nd gear 15 to 25kmph, 3rd gear 20 to 35 kmph, 4th gear 30 to 50,55kmph, 5th is beyond 55kmph. So needs very frequent gear changing in city. Its not like gixer 250 where 3 rd gear is all u need in city.. If gear shifting is not done properly, bike doesnt pull and engine starts knocking. Simply, in city, you will be busy with gearbox. So city riding is bad in this bike with traffic. Also every gearing has sweet spot where there is minimal vibrations.During highway speeds, vibrations come beyond 70 to 80kmph. Upto 65 kmph, it gives smooth ride. So, if you are enthusiast and love to rev the engine this is not the bike. Go for gixer 250 or duke 200,250. Its a cruiser bike and it is for those who love highway relaxed cruising. But if we compare it to royal enfield classic 350 or thunderbird 350, avenger 220 is much more smooth engine. No vibrations on mirrors upto 80 to 90kmph. Servicing cost is cheap. Takes almost 600 to 700 rs for one service. Fuel economy is okay. Depends on how u ride the bike, gives best economy when, 55 to 65 kmph at 5th gear and 35 to 40kmph at 4th gear... Gives upto 32 to 35kmpl if ridden carefully. Don't rev hard and brake aggressively if u want more mileage. One very bad thing is bajaj did not provide rpm meter in avenger, but pulsars have rpm meter. Always try to ride below 4000rpm to get relaxed ride. I achieved 120kmph top speed, frankly it should not be done. I thik, upto 80 to 90 kmph speed is safe and adequate.Quality of parts are not good, well its cheap in price also compared to duke 200,250 nd gixer250. Many parts tend to get rust in rainy season.I have faced one gross issue with this bike, battery went down and i had to replace it with a new exide 9v solid state battery of 2000rs, at that time, lockdown was going on, so did not get any customer support. See, my bike is only 8 months old, and this battery issue is not expected from a bike of this price. I have also heard about battery issues of avenger from other guys in fb group. Replacing it with new battery has resolved all problems but this should not have occurred in first place within one year of buying.Headlights are decent and looks badass from distance.I recommend if u want to go for it, then take street bcs street 220 gives tubeless tyres. But cruise 220 gives more raised handlebar and upright posture.In mountains, best is 2nd and 3rd gears to pull this bike uphill.Pros: very comfortable, relaxed, big bike feeling and minimum vibration(compared to enfield bikes), also low seat height is good for short riders and novice riders, long seats help during bag packing in back seat.Cons: long base, so handling is not great in traffic, narrow streets and bad roads, cornering is not confidence inspiring, brakes are average and low end torque is not good.Verdict: its a bike for mature riders who loves comfortable speed highway cruising and touring, not a good performer in bad roads but absolutely gem in highways. Wish it would be available with dominar 400 engine and premium components.Rating Parameters(out of 5)3Visual Appeal4Reliability3Performance4Comfort3Service ExperienceAbout the ReviewerUsed it forEverythingOwned for6 months-1 yrRidden for5000-10000 kmsRead More\n",

      "I bought avenger 220 cruise in December 2020 and I am amazed to see its performance.I heard about that this bike is only for long route but believe me I am riding form past 1.5 years, I found no such issue, yes its turning radius is bit more as compare to other but it hardly troubles.Best part :1) unmatched comfort.( I ride 325 km in a single day but didn't feel like)2) average is around 35 to 40 km/l  in city and 45 km/l on highway. (what else you expect from 220cc engine)3 ) low maintenance.  4) vibrations are very less, it starts above 95 (though less)5) chrome work that provides a stunning look to the bike stunning.6) blue light in digital console meter makes the bike unique from others.Improvements requires (in my view):1) there is no tubeless tyre, although I didn't  find any difficulty till now but yes if company will provide this in future, it will like cherry on the cake.2) pillion seat is not much comfortable, less space provided for pillion rider.3) company should provide double channel abs, right now this bike is having single channel abs.At the last I would recommend this bike as I have a pleasant experience & moreover the price range is very good although some improvements are required which I have mentioned above but still this bike is value for money and no one is going to disappoint after riding this powerful bike.Rating Parameters(out of 5)4Visual Appeal5Reliability4Performance5Comfort4Service ExperienceAbout the ReviewerUsed it forDaily CommuteOwned for> 1 yrRidden for10000-15000 kmsRead More\n",

The bike is very comfortable for driving in the city and on highways.

      "Avenger cruise 220 is one of a kind cruiser in India. I personally has always been a fan of low height bike for cruising due to which I chose avenger to be my first bike in Feb., 2021 and bought it from local dealer taking delivery on the same day. Since then, it is used as a daily commute vehicle for a daily travel (on highway road) of 75 kms with an average mileage of 50 kmpl. Achieving this mileage requires quite a lot of pampering to bike like lubricating the chain every 500 kms, cleaning air filter every 1000kms and a weekly wash. It has a 220cc engine which is considered all good when compared to Royal Enfield bikes but the pick up gets compensated due to its lesser weight of 165 kg.As reported by others it does ride smoothly until you reach the speed of 75 kmph. After that the body starts vibrating making it feel like you are forcing the engine however, I've touched the speed of 104 kmph on the same vehicle. The bike has a digital meter which has a bluish backlight that turns on with headlight. During daytime since the headlight if off, there is no backlight in digital meter which sometimes makes it difficult to read the meter while riding. In my opinion since the meter is digital, the company could have also provided gear indicator in it. The first service was done after one month from the date of purchase. After completing a few kilometers following 1st service the virtual display started showing engine malfunction light due to which i took it to service center as recommended by user manual provided with vehicle. The service center deleted the error code using bosch toolkit and assured me that the problem is solved. However, the same error popped while riding, compelling me to take it to service center again. To solve this, they changed the o2 sensor in my 3rd visit to service center which proved to be a temporary solution. I informed the center about the reoccurring problem and they told me that the ecu of vehicle will be changed (after a wait of 15 days). Hence, in my 4th visit the ecu changed and engine malfunction light was gone.For a while (after 2nd service on my 5th visit to service center) the bike rode smooth as a geisel until it stopped suddenly at a speed of 70kmph on highway with heavy traffic volume during peak rush hours leaving me stranded. Before buying this vehicle, i did a lot of research on its bs6 model which helped me self-diagnosing the cause of problem. It was found that the side stand sensor fell off (the bolt provided in side stand sensor is very short due to which the nut got loosened with time and fell off) while riding which made it impossible for bike to run (refer function of side stand sensor in bike). I had to hire a tempo to transport my bike (metaphorically a dead fish in water) to service centre (6th visit). It took about 15 days (again) for the service center to solve the problem as they didn’t have this part too in stock during which the bike stayed at centre.After riding for 2 weeks from receiving my bike the engine malfunction light popped up again. I again informed the service center and they asked me that the wiring need to be replaced which was also out of stock and I had to wait for 15 days. As the time of truth came (7th visit), the wiring was replaced with new one which proved to be a fruitless solution compelling the mechanics to again replace the wiring with old one. Ironically, replacing the new wiring with old one did the trick.The 3rd service (8th visit) was done in the month of November before 10,000 kms following which the engine malfunction light again showed up decreasing the average mileage of vehicle.
