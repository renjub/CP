Regular Oil Change: Change the engine oil every 3,000 km or as recommended by the manufacturer. Using the correct grade and quality of oil is crucial.

Air Filter Cleaning: Ensure the air filter is cleaned and replaced as per the recommended intervals. A clogged filter can hamper performance and fuel efficiency.

Tires:

Use tubeless tires for better puncture resistance and safety.
Regularly check tire pressure. Maintaining the right pressure ensures better grip, safety, and fuel efficiency.
Inspect tires for wear and tear. Replace if tread depth is below the recommended limit.

Brakes:

Check brake pads for wear. Replace if they're too thin.
Ensure brake fluid is at the correct level and replace it as recommended by the manufacturer.

Battery:

Check the battery terminals for corrosion. Clean and apply petroleum jelly to prevent corrosion.
Ensure the battery is fully charged, especially if you don't ride the bike daily.

Drive Chain Maintenance:

Regularly clean and lubricate the drive chain.
Check for correct tension and adjust as necessary.
Regular Service: Stick to the recommended service intervals. Timely servicing ensures the bike's longevity and performance.

Lights and Indicators: Regularly check all lights and indicators. Replace any blown bulbs immediately.

Coolant Level: If your model is liquid-cooled, ensure the coolant is at the correct level and replace as per the manufacturer's recommendation.

Use Genuine Parts: Always use genuine Bajaj parts for replacements. This ensures compatibility, performance, and longevity.

Storage: If you're not using the bike for extended periods, store it in a dry place and cover it to protect from dust and moisture.

Ride Regularly: Bikes are meant to be ridden. Regular rides, even short ones, can prevent issues related to prolonged idleness like a drained battery or seized engine parts.",32,10

It has some practical segment first feature like dual channel abs in the price segment is just amazing within the price bracket. No other manufacturer has dual channel abs in this segment.This is not just a pulsar it's a most refined new gen pulsar.Gear shifting is pretty smooth.

Bajaj Pulsar N160,5,Bajaj pulsar n160 honest review,"The all-new bajaj pulsar n160 is a motorcycle which bajaj auto says will become the entry point into the premium sports segment, although it's still a premium commuter in the 160 cc segment. The pulsar n160 will share the bajaj auto line-up with the pulsar ns160 launched five years ago. The pulsar n160 has nothing in common with the pulsar ns160, and is built around a new engine, new frame, new gearbox and an edgy new design shared with its bigger sibling the bajaj pulsar n250. With the new pulsar n160, bajaj hopes to take the fight to established rivals in the segment.Design & featuresThe design of the pulsar n160 is familiar, almost identical to the bigger pulsar n250. Up front is the aggressive, and futuristic face, with led drls and projector headlamps, and the small bikini fairing flanking the fuel tank. The split seat is wide and is nicely padded for comfort; it also has a low height to suit riders of different heights and build. The part analogue, part digital speedometer console may look a generation or two old, but it offers all necessary read-outs, including distance to empty and a gear position indicator. The top of the fuel tank also sports a handy usb charging port.Engine & performanceThe new 165 cc engine cranks up with a bassy note from the underbelly exhaust. The single-cylinder, two-valve air and oil-cooled unit puts out 15.8 bhp at 8,750 rpm and 14.7 nm of peak torque at 6,500 rpm. The new engine is smooth, probably the smoothest in any entry-level pulsar ever! gear shifts are slick and precise, and the 5-speed transmission complements the engine's refinement. There's enough low- and mid-range grunt to keep things interesting in traffic, and the spread of torque of the engine is nice and wide, so there's plenty of shove till the mid-range.Acceleration in city speeds is quite impressive, and the pulsar n160 will get to 70-75 kmph effortlessly, and actually impresses with the engine's refinement and the smooth-shifting gearbox. The riding position also is fairly upright and comfortable, with slightly rear-set footpegs. Coupled with its relatively light kerb weight of 154 kg, refined performance and agility, it's an impressive motorcycle while filtering through traffic. Low and mid-range grunt is adequate and more, the gears slick and precise, and the free-revving unit complements the meaty exhaust note.According to bajaj, the pulsar n160 is the fastest in the 160 cc segment in the 3rd, 4th and 5th gear from 30-70 kmph. With my 75 kg body weight, it reaches the ton and holds it quite nicely too, but if you're looking for top-end performance, that is an area where the pulsar n160 leaves you wanting more. Sure, it will hold 100 kmph, and will go slightly beyond when prodded, but 75-100 kmph acceleration is a little lethargic, if top-end performance is what you seek, although being a 160 cc premium commuter, there will seldom be many takers looking for outright top-end performance.Ride & handlingAnd when the going gets rough, the pulsar n160 can take on everything in its stride, broken roads, potholes, speedbreakers, quite effortlessly. The pulsar n160 is the only motorcycle in its segment to offer dual-channel abs in the top-spec variant. It also gets 37 mm telescopic front forks, and a bigger 300 mm front disc. The single-channel variant gets 31 mm front forks and a smaller 280 mm front disc. The wide tyres (100 mm front, and 130 mm rear) on the 17-inch wheels offer more than adequate grip, even in the wet. Braking performance from the dual-channel abs is superb, and the pulsar n160's handling and ride quality certainly leaves a very positive impression. The road-oriented tyres only lose some traction when you decide to venture off tarmac, and into the wet grass and mud. But if you're going to be primarily using it in the urban jungle, the n160 is light on its feet, has great road manners and is a delight, with its grunty and refined engine. The only negative i could think of is the slightly wide turning radius.Variants & pricingThe bajaj pulsar n160 is available in two-variants, with the single-channel variant priced at around rs. 1.23 lakh (ex-showroom), while the top-spec, dual-channel abs variant is priced at rs. 1.28 lakh (ex-showroom). At those prices, the pulsar n160 competes with the likes of the tvs apache rtr 160 4v, the suzuki gixxer and the hero xtreme 160r, but offers the only motorcycle in the segment with dual-channel abs. It's offered in four choice of colours, brooklyn black, racing red, caribbean blue and techno grey.VerdictThe bajaj pulsar n160 certainly makes an impression. It handles well, ride quality is very good, brakes are superb, and the engine offers a level of refinement not seen in any entry-level pulsar till the pulsar 250s. For anyone looking for a motorcycle in the 150-160 cc segment, the new pulsar n160 should certainly be on the list of considerations. Yes, it may not have a feature-rich digital instrument console, or may not wow you with top-end performance, but the new pulsar n160 makes for a well-rounded and refined package in the premium commuter segment, and now has all the qualities to take the fight to the very best in its segment.",2 years ago,5,5,5,5,5,Leisure Rides,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,6 months-1 yr,No Tips,17,5

Bajaj Pulsar N160,5,N160 other bikes .Read this before buying,"Go for this bike without any second thought if you're considering buying this bike, you won't regret it. Why?? let me explain..Let's start with buying experience - The buying experience was good, took a test ride of this bike and instantly fell in love with it. Got this bike on the same day ....Blah blah ... Buying experience is the same for every brand, and for bajaj it was also good.Now as for riding experience, it is unmatchable, i was considering buying apache 1604v or yamaha fzs , took test rides of both, and they were good, but the engine refinement of n160 was too notch, its sitting position, your posture while riding, your control over the bike and most impressive exhaust sound is unmatchable, unlike apache with not that good sitting posture. I purchased this bike for daily use, and trust me I do not regret my decision, pulsar n160 is fun to ride unlike any other bike I took a test ride of in this segment.Now as for the looks, you can see it in the images and can assume how good this bike looks in comparison to its rivals, it's brooklyn black colour is just too good. Everywhere I go on this bike, not a single person asked/criticized this bike , they all said ""badhiya lag rahi hai yaar bike ye "", ""kitne ki padegi hume ye bike??"" , trust me this bike is an eye turner if you're in college, you won't go unnoticed.Its performance is also top-notch, perfectly balanced, handles well on all rpm range, and goes upto 110kmph(this is how fast I could run it, till now) but top speed does not matter if you ask me as you won't be riding on 120-130kmph in your city every time. So, what matters is the mid-range of the bike, it goes upto 80kmph very quickly, so you won't feel that bike is slow, above 100kmph speed increases slowly but as I said that doesn't matter as you won't be always riding above 100 all time, also n169 handles throughout rpm , no issues with that.As for mileage, now this is a rollercoaster .. It runs for 55-56kmpl if you ride near 50-60kmph at constantly, without shifting gears too much, and can also give mileage as low as 35kmph on harsh riding.Servicing and maintenance are not expensive, around 800 on the first service, and around 1200 on the second service (due to oil change), in short, it is affordable.Pros - 1-  fun to ride  2- handles well 3- good mileage4-speeds up quickly upto 80kmph5 aggressive looking, beautiful bike6- has a smartphone charging port for emergency purposes.7- dual channel abs, ( no worries about braking at any speed, you won't crash or lose control of the bike)8- premium quality seat 9- engine refinement is good10- exhaust sound is also good to hear Cons-1. Plastic body parts on some areas(will get damaged a lot if crashed )2.

It is quite comfortable.The rider seat gives enough space to ride straight and medium lean. Hands don't hurt like riding 220F. Headlight is a king. At night riding it helps a lot. It gives a max of 51kmpl in my riding experience (tested full tank ride and refill method).Looks are not the same as mt-15 but as a pulsar lover, i wont mind. Mine looks muscle and bulky from the side and back. The engine is smooth. The gear shift is smooth. Easily can rev 90+ in smooth. Brakes are the best when it comes to safety. It gives good torque also. Servicing was not that great. Avg service cost is ₹1000 which is good. In my experience, bajaj service center doesn’t treat your bike as their own. They don’t details check as per the bike manuals. which I don’t like. Maybe in my area.Pros.1- At this price point 2- Milage and power & Looks3-Smooth engine & comfortable Cons.1- Chain sound  problem(Lubrication always needed). 2- The back suspension (monoshock) is not great.3- Mud gets into monoshock.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,4,The complete truth,"I'm posting this review after riding my pulsar150 twin disc bs-vi for about 6000kms aver a timespan of 5-6months. I ride it for about a 100kms on an alternate day basis. I've completed 2 services of the bike, each time the engine oil was drained and refilled with new. So i have ridden it with well maintained conditions. And after that i am stating that the engine is running really fine and residing upon that fact i'm gonna write down unbiased pros and cons that i faced within my time of riding it. ______________________________________________________________________Pros:1- great looks ! :  even after 20 years of launching it, Bajaj hasn't changed the base design of the bike. Of course there have been some major graphics and look changes over the past decade, but the masculine charisma of the bike still remains the same. The metal tank, sturdy & long wheelbase, and the iconic headlamps gives me the same macho appeal matching my character. Bajaj wasn't wrong when tag lined the pulsar name with ""definitely male"".2- engine refinement :  although we've heard people complaining about the pulsar's engine being rough and making noises, but i do know some people who boast about the refinement and smoothness of the bike. Let me tell you a secret; pulsar requires maintenance just like any other bike. But some people take their chances of skipping over the service periods, or not refilling the engine oil once after every 10000 kms. It is a pro for me, because as much as i know, these bikes do go on for a long period of time and kilometers only if maintained properly. I usually refill the engine oil upon every service period and clean-lube the chain after every 600-800 kms of riding.3- comfort -  riding the pulsar for 100 kms 3 days in a week for 4 months and also after a long ride of 1000 kms, i can proudly say that this is a very comfortable bike for everyday commute. The forward leaning seating posture, the riding stance and well above-average working dual shock absorbers gives you a very good grip on the asphalt. So far i haven't witnessed any comfort issues from my side, but those who like to ride in a relaxed posture(rather than slightly sporty leaning posture), I'd suggest then to test ride a pulsar for at least 10-20kms before making a choice. Although the seats could have been a little stiffer which could be a help during long rides. But for daily commute, its very comfortable. No back, wrist or shoulder pains at all. Very minimal and un-noticeable vibrations and no stress points.4- power and fuel economy :  considering both power and fuel economy are inversely proportional, bajaj has mastered both of those in the new bs-vi pulsars. Although power figures have dropped down after having fuel injected system, you don't get that punchy pickup, but what you get is certainly good enough to cruise on highways and overtake heavy vehicles without doubting the circumstances. All that and you get a mileage of 50-55 km/l in cities and 60 km/l on highways while maintaining steady speeds of 60-70kmph. But if you want more power, skip the pulsar 180 and definitely do for 220-f which shall give you about 40 km/l on highways.5- all other factors :  after all the things i wrote above, there are these subtle non-descriptive things which i like, and those maybe; the very bright halogen bulb or the dual honks which make your road presence undoubtful. The new meter console is very informative, yet still lacks gear count indicator and clock (ps: if you know how you ride, then you know which gear is your bike running on and reduction of the clock saves battery). Besides all, the braking is perfectly fine with the single channel abs. Although bajaj could have been grateful enough to feature dual channel abs like most other manufacturers, but the way i ride it, i think its manageable with single channel.  The 15 liter tank is a huge pro considering the fact that you don't have to stop at short distances to refuel.(ps- it actually occupies 16-17 liter of fuel and the range goes up to 900kms)______________________________________________________________________Cons:1- not that good weight balancing:  I've ridden dukes and apaches which are fairly heavier than the pulsar, but those bikes feel really light. Comparing to those, my pulsar feels like a royal enfield. In my opinion bajaj has been making these with the same old designed chasses and frame with the same engine placement, which results in making the bikes feel heavy and dense even when they're not. I'm a perfectly fit and healthy person and sometimes i feel maneuvering an apache or duke in a parking lot or traffic is easier than the pulsar.2- shifting :  its been about 5 months and 6000kms of riding the bike and i still feel the gears are lagging and rough. Before the 2nd service there were mis-shifts and fail-shifts which vanished after loosening the totally tight clutch and giving it a free-play of 10mm, but i still experience lags while shifting from 4th to 5th gear. The service engineers say that it'll get smooth within a year and even i hope so. I wish bajaj works upon this in their upcoming new-gen pulsars.3- material quality and paint finishes :  i have got the ""sparkle matte black"" version and over the time i'm noticing that the roughness of the matte-finish of the paint getting smooth at the tank grip position due to grabbing the tank with my knees and thighs. Also the rear seat cowl and tail lamp section had started to make noises while riding, which i had to get tightened. ______________________________________________________________________That's all my folks !  many people might complain about many things about the bike but so far I've given my insights on what I've experienced and observed. This might be the perfect bike for many people, lets say daily work commuters, students like me, or anyone with an appeal towards strong and everlasting pulsars. Looking into the standards which other bikes in the range offer, bajaj is finally going to make a complete redesign of the pulsar 150s right after launching pulsar 250s which might highlight fiber tanks and and better weight balancing. But the present pulsar 150 bs-vi is and always will be the base and fundamental deign idea behind the classic name and legendary attitude of the ""manias"" riding it.This review might have got long, and over the time I'll keep it updated, but for now i've tried keeping it short while providing as much details as possible.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,Pulsar neon  get a sporty feel with fantastic look on a daily commuting bike.,"I bought pulsar 150 neon on 3rd of april 2019.  And it is really amazing. Most appealing part is its look, which gives you a sporty look on a daily commuting bike which other bike can't give you at this price segment.  Secondly you can't have a 150cc engine with perfect build quality at this price on any other brand. The ride is comfortable an you can easily drive it without any pain upto 40 km continuously. The pickup is also good. Fuel efficiency ranges between 50-55 kmpl.  Only problem you can feel on is its hard clutch which gives daily exercise to my wrist. Sometimes you can feel sudden cracking feel while changing gear from high to low. And over 80 km/hr you can feel vibration.

I used to drive in city as well as long rides in the range of 350-400 kms at one stretch. Recently, after 15 years i took a long ride from hyderabad to vijayawada on jan 18, 2020. Total kms 700(up and down). The same old pickup and wonderfully experience. I just covered 700 kms in just 8 hours 45 mins in the average speed of 80-90kmph. Even today, my bike touches the top speed of 115kmph without vibration. That's the body and performance of pulsar(2004 model). Now, i renewed the registration for more 5 years till january 2025 as it's completed 15 years registration from 2005 to 2020.It's not the bike.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,4,"Pulsar 150, commuter bike.","1. Buying experience: bike was purchased in 2011. Buying experience was pretty good. Bike was delivered as soon as the formalities were completed.   Only took 1 visit to showroom to get everything done. Smooth and hassle free experience.2. Riding experience: let's be honest, this is not a cornering machine. I don't mean that it is a bad handler, i just mean that there are better handling bikes in this segment. It does decent job while cornering and is very stable in corners thanks to heavy front end. Stock eurogrip tyres don't provide much grip. Change of tyres makes a big difference in handling. Ride quality on bad roads is simply amazing. Long hours on saddle won't be a problem. Seat is pretty wide and long. Rider and pillion both will feel pretty comfortable during long journeys.3. Looks and performance: this is probably the most boring looking bike in today's age. Build quality is pretty good. In 6 years of ownership, this bike has been crashed 4 times. No major damage occur during any of the crashes. Crash guard did it's job pretty well. Performance is nothing to boast about. It gets the job done. It has solid low and mid range. Helps a lot in city commutes. Bike performs best in 4-8k rpm range. You won't buy this bike for it's performance. 4. Servicing and maintenance: so far i have completed 45k kms on my p150. Maintenance on this bike has been minimal for me. Spares are very cheap and are available at any local mechanic? shop. Flue economy is pretty awesome. Fe for me has always been more than 50kmpl in highways. In city with pillion bike gives me 45-50kmpl. Servicing this bike at authorized service center is not recommended. Mechanics at service center are inexperienced and aren't able to do the job. After 26k kms tappet valves on my pulsar got loose and started to make noise. The guys at service center weren't able to fix it. 5.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,3,I year with the pulsar 150.,"In 150 segment, bajaj pulsar 150 is the best bike. Had a good enough look and style. As a 150cc bike, riding experience is quiet okay. Got a mileage around 48/50. Even though  from my experience i noticed  so much cons in this bike. Power delivery is slow when accelerating on starting. Handling is not nimble. Too much weighted handling make your hands tired. Comparing  to old models, new one's gear shifting  is not smooth at all. And i felt this bike as bit over weighted  in some times. Even with all these problems, without  any doubt i could say it's  a powerful bike in its class.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,Best bike in cheap price,"I'm posting this review after riding my pulsar150 twin disc bs-vi for about 6000kms aver a timespan of 5-6months. I ride it for about a 100kms on an alternate day basis. I've completed 2 services of the bike, each time the engine oil was drained and refilled with new. So i have ridden it with well maintained conditions.And after that i am stating that the engine is running really fine and residing upon that fact i'm gonna write down unbiased pros and cons that i faced within my time of riding it.______________________________________________________________________Pros:1- great looks ! : even after 20 years of launching it, bajaj hasn't changed the base design of the bike. Of course there have been some major graphics and look changes over the past decade, but the masculine charisma of the bike still remains the same. The metal tank, sturdy & long wheelbase, and the iconic headlamps gives me the same macho appeal matching my character. Bajaj wasn't wrong when tag lined the pulsar name with ""definitely male"".2- engine refinement : although we've heard people complaining about the pulsar's engine being rough and making noises, but i do know some people who boast about the refinement and smoothness of the bike. Let me tell you a secret; pulsar requires maintenance just like any other bike. But some people take their chances of skipping over the service periods, or not refilling the engine oil once after every 10000 kms. It is a pro for me, because as much as i know, these bikes do go on for a long period of time and kilometers only if maintained properly. I usually refill the engine oil upon every service period and clean-lube the chain after every 600-800 kms of riding.3- comfort - riding the pulsar for 100 kms 3 days in a week for 4 months and also after a long ride of 1000 kms, i can proudly say that this is a very comfortable bike for everyday commute. The forward leaning seating posture, the riding stance and well above-average working dual shock absorbers gives you a very good grip on the asphalt.So far i haven't witnessed any comfort issues from my side, but those who like to ride in a relaxed posture(rather than slightly sporty leaning posture), i'd suggest then to test ride a pulsar for at least 10-20kms before making a choice. Although the seats could have been a little stiffer which could be a help during long rides. But for daily commute, its very comfortable. No back, wrist or shoulder pains at all. Very minimal and un-noticeable vibrations and no stress points.4- power and fuel economy : considering both power and fuel economy are inversely proportional, bajaj has mastered both of those in the new bs-vi pulsars. Although power figures have dropped down after having fuel injected system, you don't get that punchy pickup, but what you get is certainly good enough to cruise on highways and overtake heavy vehicles without doubting the circumstances. All that and you get a mileage of 50-55 km/l in cities and 60 km/l on highways while maintaining steady speeds of 60-70kmph. But if you want more power, skip the pulsar 180 and definitely do for 220-f which shall give you about 40 km/l on highways.5- all other factors : after all the things i wrote above, there are these subtle non-descriptive things which i like, and those maybe; the very bright halogen bulb or the dual honks which make your road presence undoubtful. The new meter console is very informative, yet still lacks gear count indicator and clock (ps: if you know how you ride, then you know which gear is your bike running on and reduction of the clock saves battery). Besides all, the braking is perfectly fine with the single channel abs. Although bajaj could have been grateful enough to feature dual channel abs like most other manufacturers, but the way i ride it, i think its manageable with single channel. The 15 liter tank is a huge pro considering the fact that you don't have to stop at short distances to refuel.(ps- it actually occupies 16-17 liter of fuel and the range goes up to 900kms)______________________________________________________________________Cons:1- not that good weight balancing: i've ridden dukes and apaches which are fairly heavier than the pulsar, but those bikes feel really light. Comparing to those, my pulsar feels like a royal enfield. In my opinion bajaj has been making these with the same old designed chasses and frame with the same engine placement, which results in making the bikes feel heavy and dense even when they're not. I'm a perfectly fit and healthy person and sometimes i feel maneuvering an apache or duke in a parking lot or traffic is easier than the pulsar.2- shifting : its been about 5 months and 6000kms of riding the bike and i still feel the gears are lagging and rough. Before the 2nd service there were mis-shifts and fail-shifts which vanished after loosening the totally tight clutch and giving it a free-play of 10mm, but i still experience lags while shifting from 4th to 5th gear. The service engineers say that it'll get smooth within a year and even i hope so. I wish bajaj works upon this in their upcoming new-gen pulsars.3- material quality and paint finishes : i have got the ""sparkle matte black"" version and over the time i'm noticing that the roughness of the matte-finish of the paint getting smooth at the tank grip position due to grabbing the tank with my knees and thighs. Also the rear seat cowl and tail lamp section had started to make noises while riding, which i had to get tightened.______________________________________________________________________That's all my folks ! many people might complain about many things about the bike but so far I've given my insights on what I've experienced and observed. This might be the perfect bike for many people, lets say daily work commuters, students like me, or anyone with an appeal towards strong and everlasting pulsars. Looking into the standards which other bikes in the range offer, bajaj is finally going to make a complete redesign of the pulsar 150s right after launching pulsar 250s which might highlight fiber tanks and and better weight balancing. But the present pulsar 150 bs-vi is and always will be the base and fundamental deign idea behind the classic name and legendary attitude of the ""manias"" riding it.This review might have got long, and over the time i'll keep it updated, but for now i've tried keeping it short while providing as much details as possible.

Your bike became a horror and every time they change the engine oil whether its 7 days of last service or 1 month. And every time they say clutch plate problem. Please change and maintenance charge is approx 3000-8000 single service charge. In my opinion please boycott Bajaj.5. Pros and cons :-Pros:- it good for daily usage Comfortable seatCons:-The whole bike is a cons because after purchasing Pulsar you will regret it. In the Tank and seat only things working fine.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,4,Most value for money 150cc motorcycle,"Riding bajaj bikes forever in our family, & i am riding pulsar since 2012. Last december bought my second one, the 150 classic, just before neon came into fray. And definitely i love this bike. Vfm, powerful, now more refined than before, & more mileage too. Also very basic build design accesses easy & quick repairs, even some i do myself. My old one gave around 43 kmpl, this one gives 45-48, city-highway. I always prefer riding with my tank full, & refill after every 200km to ensure best performance & mileage. I also use very lean air-fuel mix to get best possible mileage, but keep the engine at steady revs, around 1100 rpm, so that it doesn't hiccup. One & only tip for any & every bajaj bike - don't keep a problem for later, parts are damn as hell cheap, so go for it, & it will keep your bike literally maintenance free. My previous one, in 6.5 years, had a total maintenance cost of around 7500, except engine oil changes, which i do myself. The cost includes everything - from brake shoes, pads, brake oils - to clutch cables, accelerator cables, bearings, one time clutch assembly replacement after 35000 km, etc. Our discover 100, same age now, has even lesser expense, gives 58 kmpl average on city conditions. Another thing, bajaj makes rev happy engines, so use best quality engine oil to ensure maximum performance & engine life along with added refinement. I prefer motul 5100 semi-synthetic oil for my pulsar, after 5000km. It also has good drainage interval, 3500-4000 km, depending on your riding style. So if you care for your bike well, bajaj is the best you can be satisfied with in a compact package.",5 years ago,4,5,4,3,4,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,"Major maintenance tip for Bajaj motorcycles is - Don't leave a problem for later, no matter how small it is. Parts cost way cheaper than any other brand, be it Indian or foreign, & replacing a few of them will ensure you can keep your pocket happy & mind calm. Definitely you can own a Bajaj for years, provided you use good quality engine oil (I prefer Motul, initially 3100, after 5000 km 5100 semi synthetic for daily commute), drain mineral oil between 2000-2500 depending on oil film strength (for semi synthetic 3500-4000), keep chain lubed & properly tightened every 1000 km (for open chain a bit more frequently), & adjust wearing parts like clutch cable, accelerator cable, brake shoes, pads, gear levers regularly, if necessary change them. Use good quality tires with proper air pressure, but keep in mind softer tires provide better grip in expense of fuel economy. So if you want both, go for tires with good grip for most road conditions.",6,0

Bajaj Pulsar 150,4,"Great bike, VFM at the price - beats the competition by a narrow margin","I brought this bike at 2019. (Yellow neon one - still love the design and look), Driven approx. 8k kms now. First of all, as 150cc commuter the performance it offers considering the price is amazing. Driving it through the city is effortless. Mileage is decent, around 40-45km/l, I didn't expect more, try to make the bike run within 3000- 5000rpm where it drives the best. Till date I never faced a single issue (almost nil heating issue, no chain issue, no other issues) and took it to the service center other than for routine free servicing.Some cons I found are:1. False neutrals - I don't know if this problem still exists in the modern version, but yes it does cause problem in traffic conditions.2. The brakes could've been better - the bite especially on the front is lacking, I don't use rear brakes much.For newbies, one of the best bikes to step up - although I won't recommend touring above 75kmph in this one.",2 years ago,4,5,4,4,5,Daily Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,"1.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,Bajaj pulsar twin disc,"Bajaj pulsar 150 twin disc was launched in order to tackle growing demand of premium 150c commuter bikes in India. As most buyers are considering more power these days, many among them prefer getting more safety and premium list of components with their product. Pulsar 150 was an affordable 150cc option but lack of better equipment forced bajaj auto to consider upgrading their highest selling pulsar with a rear disc. More than just adding a disc, they made several other mouth watering additions to make buyers happy in terms of value of money buying experience.Pulsar 150 twin disc is powered by a 149.5cc, single cylinder engine producing 14 ps at 8000 rpm and 13.4 nm at 6000 rpm. The engine comes mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox while overall weight tips the scale at 144 kg. Measuring 2035 mm in length, 765 mm in width and 1115 mm in height makes pulsar 150 quite muscular in front of regular 150cc commuter bikes. It comes with 1345 mm of wheelbase and india friendly 165 mm ground clearance. The front fascia remains exactly similar with halogen headlight and similar pilot lamps. Fuel tank used here carries 15 liter capacity.Apart from the rear 230mm disc brake, pulsar 150 twin disc gets bigger 260mm front disc, 90/90-17 front tyre and much wider 120/80-17 tyre for the rear wheel. Even the suspension components are being shared with bigger pulsar 180. They offered new shade options for this model while most other features remain exactly the same as other pulsar dts-i models. Bajaj currently offers the pulsar range in 135, 150, 160, 180, 200 and 220cc engine options. The range falls between inr 64,000 to inr 1.37 lakh.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,4,My first bike  definitely male 10 years of companion,"My first bike: I have a black bajaj pulsar dtsi 150 cc (digital).It has got good looks and that was the very first thing that made me attracted towards it.I bought it in august 2010, so at that time i just had two options in bajaj; the 150cc model which i bought and the 180cc model. When it comes to vehicles, i prefer only black color and the 180 cc model was full black with black alloy wheels which were some how not that appealing, so i finalized the 150cc model with. I took it from mohan bajaj (thane). The staff was good and gave me all the details of the bike and procedures of booking and payment. I got my bike in a week. Great features: The main features of this bike are 150cc engine with 13.5 ps power, alloy wheels, auto-ignition, 5 gears (1 down, 4 up), auto-off indicators, front disc brake, 15 liters fuel tank. The looks of this bike are stunning as i said before. The shape of the tail is different from the old dtsi models. It’s given a pointed look and adds to the beauty of the bike. The tail lamp is also new and suits the bike very well. Auto-off indicators are inspired from car and get off automatically once we take the turn. This new feature is very innovative and helpful. My bike, my freedom: The bike has a very good pick-up. The riding experience is very good. It comfortable to handle and control. My first preference when it comes to vehicles is power and this bike definitely fits into my list. It’s easy to handle even in traffic. The braking is also good. Applying a 50-50 front and rear brake brings the vehicle to halt very comfortably. I got a top speed of 117 km/hr. Again i would say not recommended as it can be dangerous. However the bike was stable even at such high speed. However, the pillion might get a little uncomfortable in longer journeys. Worthy mileage(or average as everyone calls it):The mileage of the bike is also very handsome. I got a mileage of around 55kmpl which is pretty good for such a powerful bike. Even after using it for around 3 years and 9 months, the mileage is remarkable. I still get around 50kmpl and not to forget, the riding experience still remains the same. Very costly spare-parts: The only bad thing about the bike is that it has got costly spare parts. Though i faced no problem till 3 years, i had to change the exhaust due to little damage. Also the indicator and horn switch panel stopped working. I guess water mite have short-circuited it. The exhaust cost me a good 3300 bucks and another 660 for the switch panel. So the spare-parts are very costly. Grab one to rule the roads :Over-all a very good bike. In fact, the best bike in 150cc segment. If 150cc is your limit (generally parents don’t put a limit to budget nowadays, they put a limit on the power of the bike), pulsar 150cc digital is the ultimate machine for you.",3 years ago,4,4,4,3,3,Daily Commute,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,6,2

Change engine oil after 2500 km (mineral), 3500–4000( semi synthetic). Do not use synthetic during break - in period. In fact, synthetic is not needed.
Check battery acid level every six months.
Let the bike idle for 2–3 minutes during 1st start in the morning. Do not rip it if the engine has not warmed up.
Check clutch play. Lubricate clutch cable otherwise it may become hard.
Check engine oil level. It should be between the min and max marks. Putting more than max is not good. Putting less is not good. If on synthetic, check it regularly.
Do get the tappet clearance checked if there is a ticking noise in the engine ( common in pulsars ).
Don'ts:
Ripping the engine after cold start is harmful.

A loose chain can cause poor performance and may even damage the engine, while an overtightened chain can cause excessive wear and tear on the sprockets. To maintain the proper tension, the chain should be checked and adjusted every 500-1000 km or after every long ride and lubricated regularly with a high-quality chain lubricant. Additionally, it is important to replace the chain and sprockets when they become worn out or damaged to ensure optimal performance and safety.

Without Bajaj like companies popularising concept of ""performance bikes"" in India the Jap companies would be still selling boring stuff to us Indians and that too at high prices. I always get amused when Indians feel that Indian companies are not capable of manufacturing quality and reliable products. Especially when a lot of bikes from KTM which is now the largest selling bike brand in the Europe are manufactured in India by Bajaj.The fact that the question mentions Splendor makes me wonder whether this answer would please the person who asked this question.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,4,Review of bajaj pulsar 150 (2012 make).,"1. Buying experience: this bike was purchased for my brother, as he purchased a new bike he gave me his bajaj pulsar 150 (2012 make). 2. Riding experience: it is a perfect bike for daily commuters, the seat could give more comfort, which bajaj does not provide with, because of less comfort in the seating, it becomes difficult to sit on the same position for a longer time. 3. Details about looks, performance etc.: Bajaj auto has done an excellent job in the looks of this machine, there is no complaints of looks, performance is upto the mark, but only disappointment is that on a highway when the accelerator is slightly raised to 80 the handle starts vibrating. But otherwise it's an excellent bike. 4. Servicing and maintenance: bajaj promises an excellent servicing and maintenance in any condition.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,Super 150 pulsur,"I own a bajaj pulsar 150 dtsi since november 2014; i have done about 11.5 thousand kilometer since then. I love my bike and see it more advantageous than other bikes in 150 cc segment. It has the inbuilt advantages like twin spark ingnition, dual start mode i.E. Electric and kick, dual nitrox suspension exhaust tec system, ergonomic pillion seat, side stand indicator etc which is better proposition than others. When you start the engine it feels like it is roaring to go and does pretty well to reach 60 km/hr mark with little effort.Other advantage of this bike is one could start and run at 5th gear, i usually run on this gear and is enough to negotiate all uphill climb in amarkantak. The only thing you take care is start the engine at idle mode for 2 minutes which makes it heated up and ensures good fuel supply to ignition chamber. Driving in this last gear not only ensures feel good factor but also gives a great mileage of 53 kmpl. Make sure that your cruising speeds are around 45-55 kmph which would give you an astounding mileage of around 60 kmpl. I would rather stick out my neck and say this may be the only bike (150cc segment) to cover 1000 km with full tank at ideal speed on good highways.I have removed the bulky air filter and put k&n universal filter rc 1060. Only care we should take is not to put water on filter during washing. I have also changed the engine oil after covering 10k kilometers; the brand i preferred was motul 7100 4t 10w50 fully synthetic engine oil. Synthetic engine oils improves the bike performance especially the engine, clutch, gear and does provide that extra punch like fresh oxygen to an athlete. Since then its power and pick up has gone up, now it runs like a racing bike with minimal vibrations even at 95 km/hr. I ensure i get service done after every 5000 km, which translates to maintenance cost of rs. 900/year.The only disadvantage is skidding of rear wheel, which makes it prone in sandy, muddy and stony roads. I tried to counter some of these issues by putting up mrf mogrip rear tyre for better road grip. In addition for security concerns i fitted at petrol lock with key; this prevents fuel theft and bike runs only 600m without key. Here some persons feel slight inconvenience as one has to run with 2 keys and those who are forgetful should ensure to have single flexi ring so that both keys have to be taken out together. To double up security i get it insured every year (costs around 1.3k/year) plus fitted a gps based tracking device coban 303b; please ensure it’s not easily traceable while fitting. I hope the future versions have the following features (i) anti braking system and liquid cooled engine.

About 50 kmpl .Now talking about the looks, the look of pulsar 150 has been evolved in a much better way and hence had made every generation of youth crazy since it's launch.Now talking about the quality of the electrical items, my self start button had got failed after 5000 km and the wire near the throttle started rusting.So quality of electrical material is a big drawback.Also the ignition lock kit of pulsar is fitted in such way that it starts shaking due to loosening of screws after 15 days of each service.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,Not the beast but still the best,"The buying experience was good as delivery was quick,  i have been riding the bike for almost 9 years now the bike has never failed me , have done multiple average and long rides , on the 6th year of ownership had taken the bike for a mumbai to bangalore tour along with my friends who own high cc engine bike royal enfields and karizmas i got laughed and was embarrassed however on the trip all the high cc bikes failed miserably  mine was the only bike which didn't fail apart from a blown fuse which was an easy fix  fuel consumption is very low so i have very few trips to the fuel station . After that trip i just got the bearings of the wheels replaced and also did a mumbai to goa trip on the same bike years later. The bike never failed reached goa in just 11 liters of fuel maybe less . 9 years of owner ship i never had the clutch plates replaced ,never had the engine opened, never had and head gas kits blown out and never had any oil leaks from the engine. Till date i still ride the bike 5 days in a week from home to office and office to home never been disappointed with this bike , recently upgraded to ceat tubeless tyres, the stock mrf eurogrip tube tyres were a piece of crap. Had few accidents too but the bike still survived , look wise the bike was the best in looks 9 years back however the looks don't attract me anymore as there are other bikes at the same range which look the best, servicing and maintenance is on the cheaper side the disk pads cost 150 bucks original bajaj and the rear drum brakes cost 140 original bajaj. Every spare and rubber is easily available locally .Pros:Value for every penny, low maintenance cost, high mileage , good throttle response. Cons: Stock tube tyres , fuel cover leads water into the fuel tank during heavy rains, rear drum brakes.Last but not the least i do have plans to buy a new bike however i will never sell my pulsar 150.",5 years ago,4,5,5,2,5,Daily Commute,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,2,0

Bajaj Pulsar 150,3,Good  better but not the best,"Buying experience: about the buying experience i didn't have any pleasant one since i have been waiting for a long time for my bikes delivery.I was answered they had some issues with the shipping or something and also i wasn't there to receive my bike but still my brother faced a lot of delay. I dont know whether its because my city wasn't a metropolitan but still had a bad experience. I advise bajaj to maintain certain rules and norms with their showrooms. Even my tank extension was a faulty one and  its still bothering me while cleaning and even touching it. It feels like its not sturdy and shakes even when i move it with my tiny finger. When my brother asked about the loose fitting of the tank extension they used some kind of velcro tape to stick it. So cheap and its one thing that's bothering me from buying. So guys please check those things properly and don't accept if its not good.Riding experience:    then about the riding experience its really good and perfect nothing great and nothing okay . Everything is good. Some times i feel vibrations and tats normal with pulsar bikes braking seating position everything is good and comfort but still i think the new twin disc variant has a higher seat height than normal 150 pulsar, so better do a test drive.Mileage: and the mileage is always decent when it come to pulsar and that's the thing that grabbed me to buy a bajaj pulsar. I got a mileage of around 45kmpl in city roads  and more than 50kmpl on highways.Service and maintenance: about the service and maintenance we all know that the service for bajaj bike will always be pocket friendly one compared to the foreign competition.And the parts are also easily available in local areas. As far a my service cost goes , i haven't been charged more than 600 since uo to my last service comes under free one.Looks and performance:  as u all know the looks about a pulsar which haven't changed a lot in the last 10 yrs. It like if u like the design and looks of the bike from first it never looks old with those clip on handle bars and dual shock absorbers at the back. But still i advice bajaj to move to mono shock   suspension at back since its tge only missing one when compared to its rivals other than that everything is cool. And about the performance it has a decent performance in its segment and rev loving. Vibrations are there but not irritated.  If u wear helmets than the vibration sounds don't disturb, since the sound irritates more than actual vibrations i feel. Pros:1. Pricing - cheapest and a good 150 cc bike u can get period.2. Mileage - better mileage than most of its rivals 45- 50kmpl 3. Handling and seating - nice handling for all heights and the seating position for riding is not too upright like racing and not as a normal commuters.4. Low service cost cons :  1. Absence of mono shock suspension at back 2. Minor design improvement year to year 3.

Pros:-1. Best quality and looks in this price range, paint quality is superb it's still shine like one or two year old bike 2. Riding posture is good for daily commuting or for even long drive. Best pillion seat for ladies too as it has proper foot rest and seat width and length 3. It has very crisp engine sound and pickup is still unbeatable in this segment 4. Can easily attain a speed of 100+ without any shivering 5. Disk brakes are good 5. Engine don't get heat up easily, can do 150 km in single go, more than this is not even recommended in this range of engine capacity 6. Bike has good weight to power ratio means it can easily bear wind blast or sensation of passing any super high speed cars or heavy trucks, you will be enough confident at that time too 7. 45 kmpl average i'm still getting and it's nearly same from very first day and you can get this average upto 80 kmph speed, even after that it won't affect much Cons:-1. Maintenance is bit more and expensive too than other brand bikes of this segment 2. Engine timing chain is a headache, though you would be used to that soon 3. Headlight range is not that great 4. Side and main stand could be better 5. Side body panels start vibrating soon 6. Front tyre width doesn't give enough confidence, can be better 7.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,4,Better buy for first timers jack of all but not a master,"The pulsar of yester years is a must do. Snap out of the ""commute to work"" bike because  this is not a good bike for mileage. Don't know how they have given a 60+ kmpl. But i am not even getting a sound 40kmpl on it. I had bought the 2012 dts model with twin shades of red and black with striped back end. You don't get goosebumps as in previous colour coding but it is passable. The buying price was rs.78,432. For another 1990 i would have got a fz, but i settled for this one. So basically done the paper work. The showroom was full of other bikes in line. Say i could try a cruiser bike like avenger at rs.100000, but i was still sold on pulsar. Not about money though. The bike showed a marked disk brake than my previous hero honda bike. It had  the big fuel tank but it missed the look of previous versions.The riding was easy than other bikes because of accelerator design and implementation. The torque was not as good as starting model but it should be fine for amateurs. Go for 180 or 220cc if pickup and torque is your priority. The maintenance is pretty basic and i am not sure of more advanced modifications. The showroom service is best for more detailed breakdown of work and answers.This bike is going good for 3 years but with loss of pickup, chains sprocket and shocks.The fuel gauge is not accurate and digital speedometer is good. There has been nominal service cost of the bike with single hand maintenance. Braking is a good at a glance but can be improved. Drums seem to ware a lot.Pros: The brand name is sorted. Overall good and brawny look.Need minimum maintenance. Not bad for firm handling and no vibration.Dual tone colouring.Cons:Not a mileage favouring bike.Keeping quality less and less resale value.Spares parts are not in running. Mostly other parts are sold for the overhaul.Don't have sturdy tyres and grip of bigger bikes.Built is not metal frame of previous version but of light plastic.Colour coding is outdated.",6 years ago,4,3,3,3,4,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,Don't use the clutch as hard because it is easy transition gears and go on 2nd gear in traffic than on 1st for more mileage.,1,0

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,Proud owner of pulsar 150,"The buying experience was easier, just paid cash and took bike instantly.The riding experience is very good with good pick up and handling. You can feel the bike while riding. Easy to overtake any bike of 150 or 160 cc segment.The only problem i felt is while shifting gears, sometimes it needs more force to shift and the gear shift sound can be listened loudly. Apart from that the bike is worth the price with low maintenance and a good mileage of 50+ in city and 60+ if you ride in 80 kmph and makes proud while riding. The throttle is very good between 0 to 60 kmph speed and aggressive.. Good in turns also with easy handling. I made 118 kmph as top speed in high way with 2 people on bike with very less vibrations. Service done once every 5000km and maintenance is very little(regular oil change for 5000km and maintaining correct tyre air pressure).Pros:Best bike in mileage in 150cc. Aggressive.Good handling and ground clearance.Cons:The style of the bike should be improved(looks old compared to new bikes of other company).The clutch and gear shift sometimes feels hard to shift.",6 years ago,4,5,4,4,5,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,3-6 months,No Tips,1,0

The shocker is great and never let you feel shock in off road riding. Pulsar 150 comes with a sporty look as usual which suits everyone personality. On other hand with sporty look it is also comfortable for daily ride. It's a bonus point of getting mileage of 45+ in a 150cc bike. Maintenance cost is very less compare to other bike such as honda shine, tvs apache and etc.Now lets come to pros and cons. Pros: 1. Cheap in price but best in performance. 2. Smooth riding in off road. 3.45+ mileage. 4.Brake. 5.Shocker. Cons:1. In my view there is only one cons e.G., top speed is 115. It should be atleast 125 as it is 150cc bike. Over all rating in my point of view is 8 out of 10.",4 years ago,4,5,4,3,5,Everything,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,"Change engine oil after every 5000 kms.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,The best way to describe the bike is sexy beast ruling the streets of India.,"1. Buying experience - awesome experience bought the bike on emi on 2014.2. Riding experience - comfortable, best for long rides and city rides. Easily gears can be shifted you can it is makhan type. Seating is so nice even the pillion riders are comfortable while on the bike. 3. Details about looks, performance etc. - sexy head light, parking lights are like eyes of sexy babe glaring at you in the night.  Looks like a beast. 4. Servicing and maintenance - servicing and maintenance is needed. The more you maintain it the best results and experience you can get in the bike. 5. Pros and cons - overall best bike ever only con is that we have maintain as a baby to ensure you get the best performance from the bike.  Once i have faced issue for not maintaining the service of the bike the bike use to get switched off in middle of the road. It is really tough to star once it is off as you have not maintained or serviced for long time. But once i got it serviced the bike was back in action and never faced any such issues.  Every 60-90 days i ensure that complete service is done on the bike and everything is cleared and clean oil is changed time to time or based on the kilometers you travel i suggest you change the oil for every 1000-2000 to avoid any issues with the bike. Brakes are other parts are need to changed time to time to avoid any failures while driving. It is better to be safe than sorry.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,3,Pulsar definitely bang for your buck,"Back in 2018, when the bs4 models were just rolling out and bajaj was going wacky with it's pulsar lineup, i bought my pulsar 150 (dyno red variant) and tbh it didn't have twin disc or a belly pan like today's pulsars but still looked and performed like a good first bike. After 2 years, the engine is what i'm concerned with as it makes a rattling noise when idle but rest assured, it hasn't lost it's lustre or performance, in terms of mileage, good midrange gears or the grunting revvings, in all of the time i took it far and wide. Though it costed me around rs. 95, 000 (on road) being on of the first bs4 bikes to roll out, the maintenance has been of no sorts of hassle.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,4,Definitely male is also value for money,"Well, when it comes to writing about something..... I find it tough to express but not when it's a topic of interest. Bajaj pulsar has always been a game changer for the bajaj auto. I had bought it in year 2009 and today will share with you my experience and review about the ""definitely male"" bike. Let's start then....1. Buying experience: it was mixed bag for me as the dealer was very busy due to high demand of this bike, so he didn't pay attention to my requests as anticipated. However, i had a multiple rounds of trials and they were supportive there. The annoying thing about the bajaj dealer (rather all auto dealers) was, they were forcing me to opt for insurance company having their tie up....Which i felt quite expensive as compare to other options. And the other bad thing was to sell the accessories at a very high price. Overall the experience at dealership was below average so 3 out of 5 for this.2. Looks: it's intimidating and strikingly attractive with the options available in the market at that time. I opted for a black colour and seriously it looks amazingly good on pulsar. The stretch seats and the fuel tank also add beauty to the overall stance of the bike. The headlight cluster was complimenting to the tag line of this bike and has got some attitude. The bike feels heavier especially if you were riding the likes of splendors earlier. I will give 4.5 for the looks out of 5.3. Riding and performance: it's a street bike and not a cruiser so i had to rule out ultimate riding comfort. But to my surprise pulsar offers great riding comfort. The suspension could have been better though but still it gives tall riding position with comfortable seating. Performance is good if not great and fulfills most of your needs. Braking was excellent and this is the 1st one to introduced disk brakes among few others. One negative is it takes frequent gear shifting especially in city rides. The mileage is below 60 whenever i tried measuring but mostly due to riding it in to city traffic. 4. Maintenance: the maintenance on the equipment side is less compare to the other items like rim colour, paint, oil seal leakage, etc. Which is quite frequent. The routine service takes 4 to 5 hours at service station. The most problematic area for me of this bike was attending the issue of frequent oil leakage from the front suspension bars. The engine performs at par with my expectations. The other issue is heating of engine quite immediately when i took the long highway rides. It flames up even with the 50 km ride with 80 - 90 speed....Which inspires to take short tea breaks (if we take this in a positive sense :p). Overall 3.5 out of 5.5. Pros and  cons:Pros:- good looks- stylish and ageless design- affordable price- front disk brake- large service network across india- reasonable fuel economy- definitely male- value for money. Cons:- painting quality could have been better especially on rims- front disc brakes are more prone to accidents (as many are not used to it)- seats are slippery and not comfortable for long rides- frequent gear shifting is cumbersome- standard bike doesn't come with basic accessories. To conclude my longer than usual review, i find pulsar a stylish bike with attractive features and some attitude which surely intimidating. In short a good value proposition.",4 years ago,4,4,4,4,4,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,1,0

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,Dream bike of youth pulsar 150,"Bajaj has amazing customer service, the associate was very friendly...Pulsar bike is decently refined works extremely well in city traffic, very easy to handle. Just a little drawback is that the bike was bit higher in emi as compared to the other in segment but excellent mileage compensates for it.With decent riding you will get about 50-55kmpl on average which is like a blessing.Bike looks absolute gorgeous definitely feels like you're sitting as royal seating. Headlights are pretty stylish than other bikes in 150cc segment. Braking is pretty good and does the job very smoothly.Pros:1. Very premium looking motorcycle as in one word pulsar is boss of 150cc segment ever.2. Punchy engine with excellent average3. Seat is very very comfortable for both.4.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,4,Straight from the horses mouth,"Great engine with oodles of power. The pulsar dtsi 150 I own works great whether I wish to ride at low speeds or revv up. This bike also requires minimum maintenance. Braking is good. Maneuverability is good. It is stable at most riding speeds. What I do not like is the sunk seat design. It is not comfortable especially for tall guys like who would like to slide a bit farther back while on a long ride. The petrol tank could have been a bit smaller. I also do not like authorized Bajaj service center since it seems they are mainly focused on engine service but will not attend to other things like swing arm bushes or refurbishing front forks. Where Bajaj cheeps out is the use of thinner gauge sheet metal. The exhaust pipe developed holes and so did the fuel tank -- something that never happened to my older Hero Honda cd 100.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,3,Legit review about the pulsar 150,"1. The staff was pretty decent, a few had no knowledge about the bikes, i feel that bajaj should first get good staff who can talk about the bikes available in there showroom. 2. The riding experience was not bad, i feel that bajaj should take a step towards the low end pulsars, everyone should get an opportunity to experience a good ride irrespective of how much they earn. The tyres are pathetic, braking is not on point. I was facing lot of problems with the electronics of the bike. 3. Look wise the bike has a sporty feel to it, i love the tail lamp, seats are comfortable, headlight range is any day better than apache rtr. The bike has a good pick-up, but eventually it starts to vibrate a lot. 4. Servicing of the bike was not a pain, they are good when it comes to the servicing part. 5.

At the time of delivery, as they knew it was my first bike they made me aware of the run-in period and that I should not drive it beyond 40 km/h till 500 km.Also got one helmet and one lock as an accessory from them. Great experience.I am using it as my daily driver. I ride for approx. 60 km daily in city and highways and it shines. It is easy to ride in the city, the handling is quite good. On the highway, once you are above 7000 RPMs or 85 KMPH vibrations kick in though it is manageable. As for the top speed, I have struggled to reach a triple-digit past 94 km/h. Considering this is a daily commuter, it feels decently planted at high speeds but on corners needs to be careful. Breaks are just commendable, ABS kicks sometimes early but has perfect stopping power. In rainy seasons, the tires can make you feel a bit doubtful about the grip but have an adequate grip. The pillion seat is comfortable too.The suspensions are perfectly calibrated.Looks fantastic, I own a black color version.Maintenance is easy on pocket and not to forget the large network of Bajaj.Pros:- Looks good- Great handling in the city- The brakes are awesome- Build qualityCons:- Vibrates beyond certain RPMs",28 weeks ago,4,5,3,5,5,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,6 months-1 yr,No Tips,2,2

I'm fully satisfied with it after all it's very cheap to maintain and also has a sporty look, good for daily commuters, you got great braking experience in it, usually if you keep maintain your bike it takes around 2 or 1 service in a year or after 5000 km according to my use (it maybe vary on the use of rider).

Bajaj Pulsar 150,4,Average,I took 6 years back as there were no other competitors. I purchased for 72k on road now the prices have increased unnecessarily above 80k with no change in the bike. This is a budget oriented bike. Looks are awesome. Riding quality is also pretty good. Till now i have no such issues in the bike. As i never got the chance to visit the service centre. Till now i have just changed the battery. And regularly serviced every 6 months. The petrol tank is also pretty big. The problem only arises in the rainy season the water enters in the tank if the rain cover is not applied on the tank. It gives an average of nearby 30-35 which is very decent. It takes potholes with a ease. At that time it was a big thing that i got a big digital meter. Sometimes i face the this issue while riding the gear gets shifted automatically to any no. Due to this you can't accelerate at that particular time. It starts vibrating above 70_80 kmph. I rode this bike to the max speed that is 120 kmph. I fell down with this bike 3 times due to urgent braking. As the tyres are thin and the grip is not proper,7 years ago,5,5,3,3,4,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,Don't go for this as this is an average bike.

You can easily drive it at heavy traffic areas or on highways. About maintenance, maintenance is very basic and your pocket friendly, it's parts are also affordable.Now, the worst part about this bike is service centres, they never try to understand your problems and they are just arguing on every topic you complaint i never feels satisfied at bajaj service centres.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,The black cat,"The bajaj pulsar 150 was among the most important motorcycles to hit the indian roads at the turn of the 21st century.

Performance wise they have a 15bhp was a pleasant for 150cc bikes among services they cost is very much less around 1500 including engine oil,chain lubricant,waters wash ,and some what general check up means bake wheel alignment  pros and cons 1. Mileage 2.Low maintenance 3.Easy available spare parts cons 1. 20000Km after the engine noise sound 2.When reached 110+km speed the bike vibrating so much 3.Engine over heating",7 years ago,4,3,2,5,4,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,"Please don't instal the k&n air filter .The main reason is i have installed in 15000km and i have ride in 20000km my bike performance was very low and bike mileage giving before install kn air filter bike giving 59kmpl after that only 43kmpl only given and the bore damaged i went to bajaj service center they told bore damaged ,cam shaft , clutch plate , and i have repaired the total cost is 18.500Rs so plz don't instal kn air filter or any other filter my humble request",0,0
Bajaj Pulsar 150,4,Pulsar 150- honest review,"Hey guys, this bike is very good in indian streets. When i bought it for the first time it was amazing and even now it is.It has enough thrust to put you ahead of the world. Its look is awesome no more explanation regarding it. I am in love with the fuel efficiency. On indian roads, especially on the speed breakers its double stand hits the ground and leaves a bad impression.After continuously driving for more than 150 kms it can give another type of performance or change performance which lacks power.When you are in city then this bike rocks",7 years ago,4,4,3,5,4,Daily Commute,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,"Don't disassemble the disc unnecessary, ride with no hurry, control its power while cornering.",0,0

Overall a very good riding experience.3) talking about looks, it is a good looking bike (it is subjective) & as we all know this is the bike which started a performance oriented biking culture in india. So performed is satisfactory considering its price. It has enough power & torque which helps to handle traffic jams & also helps to achieve high speed on highways.4) maintenance is cheaper. My first service cost me around rs.700/-. And after 3 years (19000+ kms), it's around rs. 1200/- (full service). I think it is good. 5) pros are already mentioned above.Cons :- I) heating issue is there. Engine gets hot very fast. Engine is more noisy now.Ii) after 2 years, my bike's rear rim started getting hot. More hotter than silencer. Service persons fixed it in 2-3 attempts.Iii) power :- i feel that on highways it begs for more power. I have not achieve more than 92 km/h speed on this bike. Even 125 cc bikes are fast than this.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,Sergeant red reckless,"I call my pulsar 150 dts-i a ""sergeant red reckless"" and please don't mistake her with the word ""recklessness"".  i am calling her so because of 2 main reasons one is because seargent reckless the ""horse"" has a history of being ever helpful on all times especially during the war. Reckless was a mare who was bought by members of the united states marine corps from Koreans and trained to be a pack horse for the recoil-less rifle platoon, anti-tank company, 5th marine regiment , 1st marine division. The marines renamed her ""reckless"" as a contraction of the name of the recoil-less rifle and a nod to the daredevil attitude associated with those who used the gun, that was a bit of history.   now, ever since i had her, every time i sit on her and ride, i notice many women and few men look at us and that is how much visually appealing she is, and she compliments my looks to a large extent. She's useful with her moderate weight of sub 140 category, 149 cc which gives intended pickup, the colour red which matches her body, she's a perfect utility bike for everyday use provided u service periodically and maintain her in a good condition.    5 gears with good speed makes her a good sports bike apart from a commuter bike that's why we can call it a real ""transformer"", I've used her for normal riding, leisure riding and also during times when i was racing against time and she never disappointed at all.    her body is classic yet sporty with good ride comfort and proper spacing between fuel tank and seats, foot-rest at the right place. I have also gone on long rides and achieved maximum speed of 125 km on full throttle against the wind on the salem-kanyakumari highway. That was one heck of an experience it seemed like i was zipping through the roads and piercing through the wind, most importantly i felt as if i was flying. Yet, when riding in the city i do not do that and i am very cautious about her getting hurt due to bad roads so i do not cross beyond 60-70 kms, also as i need to care about her engine and shock absorbers which is a bit sensitive. Servicing is quite decent when it comes to pinch on your pockets, digital speedometer, odometer, low-fuel warning and fuel gauge are added advantage and it's led lights and back-lights are certainly a highlight. Safety is pretty good with required road grip. Use motol 5100 oil for engine. Clean spark-plugs at least once in 50 days. Pro's - comfortable wide extended seating, pricing, looks amazing, good speeds can be achieved and the best pickup in these segment of bikes. Black alloy wheels and disc brakes does it's job. Maintenance isn't costly.Con's - if u don't oil periodically on time then the bike engine would not cooperate and would make you feel awful with smoke. Best usable for 3-4 years with proper care and maintenance. Not suitable for bumpy roads.Verdict : best suited for a person who's looking for a stylish commuter vehicle with a lot of appeal a bit of sport as well.",6 years ago,5,4,5,5,4,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,I recommend oil to be changed at-least between 1250-1500 kms.,0,0

Bajaj Pulsar 150,4,A good bike for any use long travel single use,"16 october 2017: from being the most popular bike to the most influential bike in the Indian market, the bajaj pulsar 150 has been a successful trendsetter from the pune-based two-wheeler manufacturer. The 150cc naked street-fighter features wolf-eyed headlamps with auto headlamp on (aho) that offers a well -targeted illumination for better road visibility to the rider. The new contoured seat of the popular commuter ensures voluminous comfort to the rider in his upright sitting position. The aerodynamic fairings on the bike further add to its appealing styling that is a product of premium quality paint job and laser edged graphics. The great amount of praise pulsar 150 shares in the Indian market is also owing to its well-refined 149cc 4-stroke, twin spark dts-i engine that is in compliance with bs-iv emission norms and delivers decent peak power and torque values of 14ps @ 8000rpm and 13.4nm @ 6000rpm respectively. The pulsar 150 has a claimed mileage of 65kmpl and a top speed of 110kmph. The pulsar 150 ensures you a premium ride quality in the city and on highways inferable from its telescopic front suspension units and 5-way adjustable nitrox shock absorbers at the rear. You can confidently depend on the rear 130mm drum and the front 240mm disc unit for the braking capabilities. The pulsar 150 comes in four equally appealing colour options: laser black, chrome black, nuclear blue and dyno red. The bajaj pulsar 150 retails at a price of rs 84,393 (on road, palakkad) to compete capably against the honda cb unicorn 150, tvs apache rtr 160 and the suzuki gixxer.",6 years ago,4,5,4,5,5,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,"Change oil 10000 on for best feelings, Change tyre 10000 on",0,0

Riding pulsar is also a very awesome thing. Because of the 150 cc engine it gives us a wonderful experience. For the youngsters who love the speed this bike in the 75-85 thousand budget has no other alternative to go with. Looks of pulsar are fabulous. The sport look is the best to prefer one. The wings,the 3d pulsar logo, sporty look  exhaust, the footrests,guards,led tail lamps, all gives it a fantastic and presentable look. Performance of pulsar for me was always the best from rest. I had been used more than 4 bike up to now but the pulsar experience is probably the best. Also i would write about the mileage. Because the 150 powerful engine bike has a unsatisfactory average on the normal city streets. Also we have to keep the reserve tank always full to avoid less mileage which is about 2.5 to 3.0 l. Tank. Service from bajaj is also good. Every time after it's servicing bike's performance is like a new one. Maintenance of bike only consists  of time to time service from authorised service station's only. People who want a amazing speed experience should definitely buy pulsar 150. But also on other hand who also wants  a good mileage bike will have spend some more money for fuel after getting it..",6 years ago,5,5,5,5,4,Everything,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,A time to time service would give you the best experience of riding a bike.,0,0
Bajaj Pulsar 150,4,Pulsar is definitely male!,"I bought a p150 after a big confusion due to rumours with pulsars getting involved with accidents always. I was adamant and was always fascinated for this definitely male ride, and booked one on a Nov '11 afternoon. The dealer offered to give me one the same day, if i'd wait for an hour or so; i was reluctant though. Got it delivered the next day. First thing i noticed was a bent mudflap, and unwashed ride. Cant express my disappointment for the dealer nor their pdi. Things moved on after i rode it, and instantly got connected to the raw'r' feel, the control in-spite of power, and the illuminated buttons. There was nothing to hate, at first.Looks were the main thing, everyone loved it. Kerala is where you find a pulsar in every bike rack. Maybe 10-15% of every bike on the road used to be pulsars. The wolf-eye lamps got a lot of attention, but not more than the white backlit buttons or the auto cutoff indicators. However, i really rally wished they've included a clock too in the console.Performance was up to the mark, and 74k well spent.Never missed the first 5-6 services, but once i started skipping, i started hearing noises from everywhere. Over the years, the performance did come down but still cannot believe the bike is still in good condition without much attention given. All i do is oil change like every 6 months or worst  time gaps. Maintenance is easy on the pockets, and kind of every workshop is in sync with a pulsar. So no complaints there.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,Thrashing beasts...,"Well, i have to say that this is one of the most amazing commuter rides from amongst all of its competitors: as the bike is quite optimum in performance and goes out thrashing the winds over the ruts road & the sloppy hills very precisely. It carries you in the most comfy and sporty way & the visual & graphics along with the decals & cowls catches the glances all over. I have been using the bike since the last past 3 years now & it's the smoothest yet powerful bike of this segment. The average goes upto 55kmpl @ the top speeds of 60 in the streets. For rash drivers, that would still gives you an amazing 40-45kmpl. The roaring sound of the engine is the most versatile as well as demanding. Riding stance & handling is comfortable & yet encourages the rider with a very sporty feel. The engine always is more demanding & you would always like to drag it more & more as it gives you more confidence on pick-ups, edgy turns & suspension all along.

The power i get from this machine is something matters in the segment of 150cc. It gives a punchy riding experience in city riding nd while take off the other vehicles u don't need to think twice because of the acceleration u get is enough for the instant pick up . Honestly saying it is one of the best bike in the segment of 150cc. Braking could be more better but in this price range the type of braking you get if fair enough. U can feel the sporty aspect while riding . Headlamp is good enough. Design must be bit sharper. Bajaj engineers must change a bit in designing specially the front design.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,You must read before  you buy!!,"Buying experience - bajaj dealers are not good. You'll rarely find any good, helpful dealer. (0/5)Riding experience - absolutely awesome. Ride quality justify it's price. (5/5)Details about looks, performance - i own a pulsar 150 classic and its black color looks classy. Performance is not the reason you buy a 150cc motorcycle. However, you'll easily commute in the city as well as on highway. (5/5)Service and maintenance - i had a worst service experience with bajaj. I recommend you to find a trustworthy mechanic who can service your bike. Regarding the maintenance, you must follow the instructions given in the bike's owner manual. That's the best tip i can give you. (0/5 for service) (5/5 for maintenance)Pros - 1. Mileage 50-55 km at cruising speed of 55kmph. 2. Looks classy and stunning.3. Comfortable.4. Commuter bike.

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,Superb bike,I it a superb bike the price of the bike is quiet good for 150cc sports bike. Due to its non-divided seat it's good for sitting space .And also the bike is very good for long rides and also in city rides.It's looks like a muscle sports bike which is good and mileage of 40-45 is good for a bike of 150cc so according to me the performance is also good.Servicing of the bike isn't too costly but obviously it's slightly high than the normal bikes of upto 100cc the biggest pros of this bike are the budget and mileage of the bike. There are few cons like it's not for those people who do rush driving and wanting the mileage upto 50 or above but the bike is my favorite.,5 years ago,5,5,5,5,4,Daily Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,No Tips,0,0

Bajaj Pulsar 150,5,Pulsar 150,"The Pulsar 150 is a popular choice in the commuter segment of motorcycles. It's known for its robust performance, comfortable riding posture, and good mileage. The bike typically features a powerful 149cc engine that delivers a good balance of power and fuel efficiency. Its design incorporates sporty elements with comfortable ergonomics, making it suitable for both city commutes and occasional highway rides. Overall, it's considered a reliable and value-for-money option for riders looking for a blend of performance and comfort in the 150cc segment.I have owned this bike for more than 5 years, I spent for service purposes is much lesser than other bikes I had in the pastI had a wonderful riding experience, my long travel with this bike is like 450 km in 6 hours, happy to have this.",14 weeks ago,5,5,5,5,5,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,Love your bike and you will know each issue of it.,0,0
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,A truly long time review!  55000 kms in 9 years !,"I bought this bike when it was launched in 2012.  Have been using it for my daily commute of 40 kms and on occasional weekend joyride. It has been a fun ride of  55,000km on this bike and about time to say good bye.  Its time to move on to a new phase, on a new bike, so this is more like a good bike review.This bike is decent city commuter and quite pocket friendly. It performs quite well when riding in city in the 40-60 range, and you can just ease into 80 and 90s on open stretches. I was very comfortable when riding under 100km in city and 120 on highway. The mileage was a decent 28-32 km/l range for most of my ownership duration, I usually ride under 7k rpm. In the 8 years of ownership the only issue I had was with the authorized service centers in Bangalore. None of them including khivraj were fair and honest. When you walk in with no complaints they don't check the bike, they just wash it and grease/lubricate the bike. They have at times not checked the coolant or oil levels! and when you have a complaint even the smallest one, they reply saying the part is broken and needs replacement. This said, i have never faced any shortage or non availability of spares. Coming to 2021, bikers are spoilt for choice. From engine sizes -150,160,180,200,250,310,350,373,500,650 and above to new brands like java, Benelli, Husqvarna, to new bikes like bmw310, Ktm 390, r15 v3, new res. But if your are a city commuter who is looking for a pocket friendly,  powerful 200cc, reliable bike then the ns200 is still a great choice. One other small issue was the rear mono suspension, it is not very effective and the pillion feels uncomfortable on bad roads.P.S if you buy one then find a good mechanic. Also the stock type is pathetic change at 5k or even sooner.",3 years ago,4,4,4,4,3,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,"Don't ride over 7-8K rpm, the bike doesn't like to be pushed over it.",220,16
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,5 years with bumblebee . . . Auto bots calling,"1.Introduction - hi,i m a photographer by profession. Many people review bikes, i don't know how to do that but i would like to share my 5 years of exp, with my bajaj ns200, i call it bumbleb. When i was studding mba my dream was to own a bike, i mean whos  not. Earlier i used to ride my papas super splendor. I live in khandala, not a lonavla-khandala, it's on the way to mahabaleshwar, just before a khambataki mountain pass. My college was in pune, so the distance is 60km, so 120km of daily commute. I was a big fan of ktm duke 200,newly launched but problem was that they had limited showrooms and i was unable to find one for me in our area. I thought bajaj distributes ktm bikes so i visited nearest bajaj showroom, asked for ktm and they introduced me this black beast ns200, my papa insisted me to buy that one, but my mind was still on duke...And somehow that sales guy and papa convinced me to buy...   Thats what append with sam in transformers when he first meet his bumbleb and was not so excited very much.... To be continued...1.Buying exp - finally bobby (a sales person) sold me that bumbleb on 2nd day, bajaj guys are very nice and supportive till date so sales and after sales service both are bang on for me. And my rest of the journey begun. Till date didn't ride ns200 nor any other bike in same class with a sporty sitting posture. I used to ride only 60-70km/h. On third day i took my bike to the college with my friend nikhil. Naked sport or a street bikes were not much popular 5 years back as of now so i didn't get major attention to the bike which i could had gathered with orange ktm so was still unhappy... To be continued 3.Riding exp. - i don't know its a superstition or truth, some of my friends told me not to ride bike above 70km/h speed till it crosses atleast 3000km, so i followed the tradition to keep avg speed of 80-90km/h, cos bike has a 6 speed gear box it stalls at lower rpm's and i was irritating to shift down everytime at low speeds, i was getting adapted to the riding skills which are required to ride these kind of heavy bhp machines. One day nikhil and me were going to college as a daily commuter, we were busy in our talk and suddenly one r15 squid passed with very high speed. Nikhil simply asked me in a joke that weather i can catch them or not, i said let's try it ou, i dropped a gear... Pulled a throttle and o boy... My daily commuter transformed into a race machine.... I crossed 120km/h... 135km/h...148km/h... I was still looking for r15 guys and they were still struggling to cope up . . . That feeling was so prod full . . . After that day i started loving my bike like crazy . . . After completing mba i used my bike for job...Weekend rides...Off road rides...Heavy rain...Deep potholes...To race with squids...Sometimes with semi pro riders...And believe me it never lets me down in any ride...To be continued...4.Looks,performance- looks like a bull from front side...Very aggressive... Very compact from back side... Petl  disks add more beauty, thr is very much room for graphics . . . Speedo meter is nice, performance is balanced, commute or race it does its job pretty well  ... It does justice to naked  sports category...To be continued 5.Servicing and maintenance - service cost is very less, just 1000-1200 bucks, i have just changed chain sprocket once, treys once, break pads twice, clutch cable once in 65000km... Mileage is very good at around 38-40km for mixed ride conditions i.E city+highway at a speed of 90-120km/h and it is constant for all 5 years, no drop in mileage.  6.Pros - for me speed, comfortable riding position, mileage and a maintenance cost 7.Cons - slight power lag in recent 2018 rides, wind blast, seat is very hard, specially in summer, chain looses frequently, can be seen in all bajaj bikes.8.Conclusion - this is my first bike and it's like a wife, the more u spend time with her more u know her, in first glance u may dislike her but day after day she will amaze u with her skills.... Love for ever... M not going to sell my bike.",6 years ago,5,5,4,5,5,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,211,18

Everyone on the road looks at it and whenever i stop atleast one person will ask about the bike.Engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox i cant say much about the engine as i have only driven few hundred kms but so far the engine seems very good, it always is very hard to conrol your temptation to speed the bike to its full potential,but i will have to wait till running in period of 2000kms is over. The fuel economy is approx 35 but i expect it to improve after first service of 500kms. The gearbox is loud when you change the gear it makes a loud noise but service center have said that it will eventually fade off with use, which i can already feel it getting lower.Ride quality & handling very nice ride quality & handling is also great.Final words it is worth the buy if you have a budget of 1l.Areas of improvement pillion seat is not as comfortable as the rider seat, will write further experiences with the bike as i ride it more.Proseverythingconsgear box is bit noisy while changing gears but over the use it is lowering",9 years ago,5,4,5,No Service Experience,No Value Rating,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Tips,31,1
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,3,Pulsar 200ns - saddlesore,"Styleit looks simply amazing in all colours, a true naked street fighter. Styling appears best when viewed from front, rear is average. Stunning looks, courtesy bajaj and edgar heinrich of bmw motorrad. The tank looks way larger/volutous as compared to its actual 12 liter capacity.Engine performance, fuel economy and gearboxperformance is great, in no ways it can be considered a slouch when compared to the duke 200 or the cbr250r. Acceleration is good and pick-up from standstill is also brisk. A top speed of 148 kmph was achieved on the speedo which in real world translates to a true top speed of 135 kmph (tested using android gps app).Fuel economy isn't bad either, achieved a 26 kmpl in bombay city and 38 kmpl on long highway runs ate speeds over 100 kmph. But the 12 liter fuel tank capacity isn't sufficient for serious touring.Gearbox is of good quality and gear ratios are well spaced to make it a comfortable ride in the city and on highways.Ride quality & handlingthis is an area that leaves a lot to be desired. The p200ns suspension is setup on the stiffer side to aid handling. The bike is an excellent handling machine no doubt, but the stiff suspension makes the ride quality pretty harsh on bad roads. Potholes and road undulations do not deviate the ns from its intended line, but transfers all the jerks to the rider's hands and butt. Add to this a minimalistic seat which literally causes a ""saddlesore"" on long hauls. The chassis is spot-on for handling, no two ways about it. Final wordswith our road conditions going bad to worse over each passing week, its not easy to live with the ns if serious touring is on the agenda. Cross winds play havoc with the bike's stability causing the rider immense disturbance on highways. The puny fuel tank and rock-hard seat don't do justice either to serious touring.Areas of improvement  bajaj should have added the self-cancelling indicators on the ns too. A well padded seat is a must for this bike, city commuters won't face much of an issue though. The bike's cross wind stability is an area of great concern, it leaves a lot to be desired. Even a naked duke doesn't budge in windy conditions. Bajaj should rework the suspension damping of this bike to make it a bit less painful for touring.Overall a good bike but my personal opinion is that if you can discount/overlook the liquid cooling, 4-valve head and triple spark of the ns, the pulsar 220f dtsi is a far better bike with excellent touring capabilities.

In Competition with Duke200 and RTR2004v.  This is exceptional as Duke known for its madness power and one should compromise with the mileage of KTMs and price difference between duke 200 and ns 200 is about 40-45k. if one thinks of buying bike with premium quality spares you can go for KTM duke 200. As the build quality is okay in NS200.Coming to RTR200 4v it is available with extra electronics and riding modes. but areas of improvement is also done in this bike but mileage we need to compromise.Overall Bajaj manufactures bike which is more suitable to Indians thoughts that should be Cost efficient, maintenance is pocket friendly and throttle response is appreciable.",1 year ago,5,4,5,5,4,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,"Depending on the mode of riding, this bike indeed pocket friendly bike for all bros.",30,5
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Best 200cc value for money bike with great power handling and mileage.,Pros :-Best 200cc naked bike that you can get in Indian market at affordable price. With lots of advance features the only thing missing was  abs but now they have added single channel abs. The engine is borrowed from duke 200 which is liquid cooled carburetor engine power is slightly less compared to duke 200 which is 23.7 ps and 18.3nm of torque . It has perimeter frame with monoshock at rear so for those who love cornering this bike for u. Also great machine on highway 6 th gear helps for relaxed cruising at around 90-100km/hr with no stress on engine top speed that i have done on this bike is 138km/hr bike is very stable at this speed bike does 0-100km in less than 10 sec. Mass centralization is very good because of underbelly exhaust. Its 200cc bike but bajaj have done good job to keep heat away from your legs in bumper to bumper traffic. Bike gives 32-35kmpl in city and on highway 40-43kmpl mileage  if u are under 5000 rpm. Its bajaj so it has large service network. Also the bike service cost is less.Cons:-1) parts quality is not that good.2)after every 500km chain starts making noise.3)no abs on/off button.4)underbelly exaust makes it worry more when we  go on large pothole.5)pillion seat is uncomfortable cushioning is not good seating feels uncomfortable for pillion on longer rides .,6 years ago,4,4,4,4,4,Tours,Never Owned,No Data,Never owned,Bike comes with stock MRF tyres which has good grip and feedback and they are long lasting.

Buying experience was pretty good and hassle free and coming to the bike i had rs 200 in my mind and test rode it, the fairing of the rs 200 had lot of vibration so went with the ns. There is not so lot change from the older ns models apart from the bottom cowl, apart from that red and white colour looks lit. Performance is really good for that price.Pros:Design is good, performance is best in that price category, handling in city traffic is pretty smooth, pretty decent for long distance travel apart from wind blast that would make one tired, riding geometry is perfect, be kind in your acceleration for first 1000km, bs6 is quite refined, looks are subjective and I feel it’s good in red and grey colour, mileage is pretty decent around 33-36km/l and while coming to maintenance it’s easy on the pocket. I would like to say after your free services give the bike to good third party mechanic, it would be less expensive than Bajaj service centre.Cons:Very stiff suspension for my riding, rusting of metal parts in a year, pathetic pillion saddle, stock battery is nonsense it stopped working after 13 months of buying the bike, and last thing is servicing in the service centre is really pain in the ass.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,The best 200cc naked bike in its segment,"I got my bajaj pulsar ns200abs bike in mar-2018 by paying rs118k. The meter now reads 5500 km covered. It has been with me for the past 6 months. Well this is my first bike i own. It has decent looks. Still in 2018 it was one of the most sought bikes along with ktm & tvs. I opted for ns200abs because of its power and safety and being value for money. Yes it's the same looking biking launched back in 2012 i guess. But it is still one of the  best looking bikes. Mileage: usually don’t keep too much track of the mileage. But i have observed that it varies from 30 to 35 kmpl. Not great but not bad too considering it is a 200cc bike. If you are too concerned for the mileage better go for 100cc. Comfort-wise it might not be the best bike. Its neither high on comfort nor the worst either. In the short trips you find it quite ok but you would feel the difference once you drive it for longer distance.Performance:it is a beast with a powerful engine.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Why choose 2017 ns over its other competitors,"1 buying experience I was always a ktm fanboy, rc series had got my mind and soul but due to price point i had to wait for something else to be in my obsession, here comes the launch need of the ns200 ... Called up bajaj showroom near my place, the person on the call was so polite and humble that he immediately said me sir as soon as the bike comes i'll give you a call. That was it my moment of decision was made:) i wanted a 200cc bike for myself and being bajaj i had all the trust and everything. Person assigned ns sales was a young guy like me, knew what to talk and what not, he literally opened all the features and cards of the bike, i enquired about all the financial details and made my booking after 2-3 days ?? because i was confused which color to go for 2 riding experience Like i said the showroom person was very polite and a really good person too, he gave me the test ride red color bike, was humble to give me a longer test ride:) to make me sure about my decision over duke, of course i didn't had the  money to buy duke. But he didn't know about it. Coming to the bike and it's dynamics, bajaj surely knows Indian customers damn well and ns is just an example of that. Relaunching it was a dream come true for me because you get naked style, not go heated up engine, the best technology, ns although the seat is a bit tall but handles very smooth in city traffic and in highways the bike above 5k rpm completely goes maniac and insane, for starting it's a slow and calm down bike, but above 5k rpm it's something else give you wide grins :) i love the stability this bike has because it's a little on the heavier side. Always stays calm and composed on the road does feel like it's wobbling. The bike offers enough speed and linear power enough for a college going student and even new married person and for India and it's road it's best offering, the mono suspensions is stiff and only thing i feel could be better :( on this bike 3 looks and performanceThis bike definitely looks best when compared to its competition, the transformer looks and signature pulsar led stop light, damn i love the looks from every angle of the bike. Every other bike offers 140 section rear tyre, while ns has 130 .. Although i feel the bigger the tyre the better the attention on road but 130 does it's job pretty neat and I've got no complaints. Performance of the bike is again is very impressive as i ride mostly in city and the bike behaves cool calm composed but when you need to overtake anyone anywhere it's just a play of twisting the throttle on this bike, the exhaust too is bassy and gives a feel of big bike.. Rpm limit is not there on this bike like on dukes, so call it a advantage or disadvantage but for me its a plus point, but i don't mean that i race everywhere. 4 service Being bajaj make, the spares are cheap and even available at any local mechanic shop. Not so hi-fi tech makes it understandable to even common person like me, i clean and lube the chain and sprocket myself.. Bajaj people call you when your bike is due for it's service, also bike has a service indicators set with in the speedometer again kudos to bajaj and team, this bike doesn't cost you pocket holes to maintain, just regularly periodic service and proper chain lubing and cleaning that's it... The bike will love you every single time you sit and ride it,  if one does follow only this5 pro and conPro - naked styleLiquid coolDual petal discNot so aggressive engineService reminder/side stand indicatorsBike comes with centre stand factory fittedBike is not on so lighter side, bit on bulk weight but that's adds to highway stability and speed riding Digital analogue display Has colors to choose fromNo rpm limitHas custom made saddle bags available particularly for this bike (viaterrawolf)Bajaj offers weekend rides and has particular group of ns riders Perimeter frameEasy to maintain as it is not so advancedThis is vfm in every way compared to its competition ConsNo absNo fiFiber tankClutch and brake levers are a bit far from normal reachPetrol inside the petrol tank shakes when stop bike in signalStiff rear mono suspension No led indicators (cmon this is a 1lakh+ bike) Still comes with eurogrip tyres",6 years ago,5,5,3,4,5,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,6 months-1 yr,"Just give your bike for regular service period as mentioned by the dealer or company, clean the chain and keep it lubed and like they say a man knows how to treat his girl, and a biker knows how to care for his machine..",19,1

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Wolf awakening again,"To all those out here fond of riding and enjoying their rides , i only have a review that is actually how i felt having this bike as my first bike.Frankly speaking i enjoyed the bike at it's lower most and the highest rpm on the bike it's A pleasure that bajaj introduced it again after discontinuing it.If i talk about the buying experience it was a great day that i totally choose the bike according to my rigorous riding altitude but as far as it is concerned when i purchased my bike for all others ,my family member's it was a bike but for me it was like that i bought my dream of riding a bike.I always wanted to have a bike so i felt glad that now i can ride enjoy each moment and understand what a pure riding adrenaline is.Secondly, if i talk about the riding experience the bike is a gem and a master piece in itself happy to have it.Riding is smooth and there is no loss of confidence when hitting corners but ensure that you have good tyres.Which is the most important part.There are no issues in riding comfortable for rider except the pillion. If you take long rides just ensure that you will have to take several halts as the pillion behind you wont be comfortable for long.Taking you towards the details and performance the bike as my title says it justifies the title for sure.Most of you must be aware of the fact that the bike ns 200 was designed by edger heinrich. Their is nothing that people don't know about ns 200 its like the looks or the design helps the high speed aerodynamics cutting edge technology that helps bike flow like water.But you will feel wind blast after a certain limit of speed which is not appropriate according to me as it would lead to certain problems.Like issues in high speed handling.Performance is the best part ns 200 is remembered for it's top end and how the bike performs on the track .The bike can be a good option for all thinking to get performance and average and thus keeping the maintenance in mind.Their is no high cost that could affect you pocket but yes if you opt for engine oils like motul fully synthetic a little increase would be there in the cost.Pros fo the bike is that it can go anywhere you want and never feels like the bike is stressed.More importantly the bike is manoeuvrable easy to handle and enjoy a safe ride.Now let's talk about the con""s of the bike their is a little vibration on the handle bar.Which is not good for such a legend.Hope that bajaj is reading this. Probably this is the cons i came to know about the bike.It is like bajaj can make this legend further more great by launching it in upper class engine segment.At last it my personal view of the bike as it's owner can give.Just remember to be riding safe for as someone is always loving you.Being a rider is a pleasure and a passion for which i always wanted to live.If there is a true rider inside you  whether  you have a bike or not. It doesn't matter the thing that matters is that how you feel when you ride all alone enjoying the ride and the bike .I feel like when i am riding that my bike tries to talk to me through it's increased volume of engine.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,A nice bike to ride,"Style: i chose this over some others mainly because of the style. This bike is a looker. Engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox: awesome. The power delivery is instant and you can overtake almost anything in seconds. I have been getting 35-36 in city and that is a great for a bike of this sort. Performance and handling at speeds is great for this bike. Ride quality & handling: the ride qualityb and handling is excellent and the bike responds very well in high speeds. You can be at ease at speeds above 80. Only issue is the handle and the turning radius. It is a tad difficult to take u turn as this is heavy and has a larger turning radius. Final words: if your budget is about 1l and you need a sports bike. I think there is only one option. Go for it. It will not disappoint. Areas of improvement: if the weight can be reduced a bit and the turning radius also needs to be smaller.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Naked beast,"My ride is yamaha facino but after a year i gave my scooter to my brother and searched for a sports bike. I have 3 choices at that time first one is ktm duke 200 2nd one is pulsar 200 ns and 3rd one is dominar 400. I really love the ktm bikes and i told my parents to buy that sexy beast for me but due to the accident rates my family didn't approved my request. I was very sad because duke is a excellent bike. After one week i test drive the dominar 400 and i fall in love with him and told my dad ' i really like this bike please buy this for me ' but he said "" 400 cc bike ?? no way you're not capable to ride that much powerful bike "" shit! now what ? i have no idea what to do. After 1 week the bajaj showroom guy called me and said the new pulsar 200 ns sale is started here if you're interested than come test drive it.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Pulsar ns 200 full review,""" acceleration, top speed, reliability, touring capability, looks, and of course - affordable "" - these are the parameters on which a young Indian biker consider before buying a bike. And what fills it better than the bajaj pulsar ns 200. Hi there, going to give you a full whack review of the ns 200.It all started 3 years ago when i had a bike fever and started searching for a good budget bike. And guess what, i find no bike better than the ns 200. Best of the segment 23.5 horses, excellent cornering, stylish & muscular looks. Bajaj launched the ns 200 back in 2012 to compete against duke 200. Despite it being a good bike, it just doesn't sell much, bajaj decided to replace it by as 200 in 2015 & then re-launched it in 2017 with a new paint scheme and a bs-4 complaint engine. Styling - at first stance the bike looks muscular & macho. The new dual tone paint scheme is absolutely fantastic to look at. It has a big "" 200"" vinyl on the tank  to differ. It from its younger sibling the ns 160. The plastic material used is not exotic but it is decent. And as being less in numbers, you will be grabbing the eyeballs of the people on the road.Engine - ns 200 produces 23.5 bhp at 8000 rpm and 18.3 nm of torque despite being carburetted. The throttle response is sharp & the engine is rev happy in nature. It can pull up in low speeds in high gears without engine knocking. It gives a great top end performance & is able to push the bike to a whooping 155 kmph. The 0-60 time is 3.8 sec and 0-100 in 10.2 sec. With being liquid cooled, you can cruise on highways with minimal drama on 100 - 110 kmph in 6th gear. And of-course the engine is very reliable.Cornering/handling - i crown the ns 200 the best handler in the pulsars stable. 'cause it is light & easy to flick into corners. With mrf- zappers you can carry a lot more speed and lean into corners & the perimeter frame acts as an icing on the cake.Braking- is done by 300mm front (abs model) & 230mm rear rotars with top class bybre floating calipers. And they provide excellent braking performance.Others - instrument cluster - it host of a tacho metre in the middle & led screen which displays fuel level, speed , etc. With blue backlit.  Exhaust note- it is raspier, throttier, & racier.Competition - here's why i prefer ns 200 over other similar bikes -Rtr 200 4v - its is a good handler than the ns but has low power output, 5 gears , oil-cooling & an unrefined engine.Rs 200 - it is heavy !Duke 200 - it is overpriced and has a top speed of only 130 kmph. Cons - no fuel injection, cheap plastic material used.And at 96000 (standard) & 109000 ( abs) it is the best of the best.Thank you very much for reading. :-)",6 years ago,5,4,4,4,5,Everything,Never Owned,No Data,Never owned,No Tips,19,5

I would suggest this bike to go on long rides instead of buying bikes with higher prices. I have clocked 140 kmph speed while riding it. But i will suggest to buy abs version cause the little jerk will cost you. The looks of the bike adds up your personality and overall it is sexy beast. For servicing you have to root out huge money in authorized service center.  Unlike other pulsars which can be repaired at roadside garage, ns do not go well with such mechanics.

Design and Build QualityThe Pulsar NS200 boasts a striking and aggressive design. Its sharp lines, muscular tank, and edgy bodywork give it a dynamic appearance. The bike features a streetfighter stance, with a split seat setup, an underbelly exhaust, and alloy wheels that enhance its sporty character. The build quality is robust, with a strong frame and good-quality plastics used throughout. The fit and finish are commendable, making it look premium for its price segment.2. Engine and PerformanceAt the heart of the Pulsar NS200 is a 199.5cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine that delivers impressive performance. With a power output of around 24.5 PS at 9750 rpm and a peak torque of 18.5 Nm at 8000 rpm, the bike offers strong acceleration and a thrilling riding experience. The six-speed gearbox is smooth and precise, allowing for quick gear shifts. The engine's refinement and performance at high revs make it an excellent choice for city commuting and spirited rides on highways.3. Ride and HandlingThe Pulsar NS200 excels in its handling and ride quality. The perimeter frame provides excellent stability and agility, making it easy to maneuver through traffic and around corners. The suspension setup, comprising telescopic front forks and a mono-shock rear, strikes a good balance between comfort and sportiness. The bike handles bumps and uneven surfaces well, ensuring a smooth ride. The braking system, with disc brakes on both ends, offers strong stopping power and enhances safety.4. Features and TechnologyThe Pulsar NS200 is equipped with several modern features that add to its appeal. It comes with a fully digital instrument cluster that provides a wealth of information, including speed, RPM, fuel level, trip meter, and more.

However, it lacks some advanced features like a slipper clutch and ride modes, which are becoming common in its segment.5.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Reliability = pulsar 200ns,"Alright.. So let me first start by saying that i was planning to buy a 200-250cc bike for quite a long time and i was confused between pulsar 200ns, ktm duke 200, yamaha fz25. After browsing thousands of article and reading/watching multiple review videos, i decided to go for pulsar 200ns. This decision not only saved my 35-40 thousand bucks but also turned out one of the best decision of my life. I am 25 and i was saving my hard earned money for almost a year to purchase a motorbike and i am super happy that i made this choice :)I have clocked 5000kms on this bike, 3rd free service is still due and i must admit that this machine is trustworthy. For beginners, who are willing to experience how a sports bike handles, this will turn out to be a good choice. I use it for daily commute to office (50-55kms) and i am always on time :)This bike is just awesome in delhi/gurugram traffic, empty stretches and maneuvering this machine is so damn easy.  One can easily cruise at a speed of 80-85 km/hr and open that throttle up to get goosebumps. Dude!I have touched a maximum speed of 138 km/hr and that feeling which you get when the bike is leaving the world behind is awesome. The bike demands sixth gear at a speed of 122-125 km/hr and that last gear easily takes you to a speed of 135+ km/hr. That's not enough. You can easily get a mileage of 35 km/ltr if you occasionally cross 100 and 30 km/ltr is confirmed even when you ride hard all the time.Talking about the looks, it very aggressive. I have the red color and it really stands out. I have also been to shimla (with pillion) and jaipur (without pillion) and the ride was very comfortable. Though it was not really comfortable for the pillion but then it was a 350 km ride. If a pillion joins you for 80-100kms ride, it won't be an issue at all. When you have plans to travel outside delhi, you need to have a reliable machine and this bike is something that can be trusted upon. So weekend rides, 500-600 km ride will not be an issue at all. Trust me!However, brake pads do take time to take their grip and you shall feel comfortable braking after you have completed 1500-1700kms.In the end, i would just say that if you have a lac rs in your pocket, go for this bike. It will cost a little over 1 lac rs, around 1.12-1.14 on-road delhi but every penny is worth.Ride safe!!",6 years ago,4,5,4,5,5,Everything,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,No Tips,12,1

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Perfect blend of power and handling,"It was a bright Saturday morning when i went to book this bike and i was told that bike will be delivered in a week of time as the colour i wanted was not available but finally got bike after two and a half weeks and in third lot after i booked the bike and i still don't know why.So lets keep that aside and come to buying experience. After the bike arrived at the showroom buying it was a piece of cake as the staff was really helpful, cooperative and easygoing towards my silly questions. And it took me a day or so to get done with all the formalities as i bought it on loan and got the keys of bike next day.Coming to riding experience and boy oh boy i was totally surprised by the linear power delivery this bike offers. While commuting in city this bike provides a perfect blend of power, handling and breaking. You don't need to shift gears continuously as the second and third gear can take you out of any kind of traffic you get stuck in.Also the bike does heat up but it is manageable as its far from the heat of a tandoor :p.When you look at the new paint scheme bajaj has come up with, it really suits the bike and does justice with the lines and muscles of the bike and the new addition of the belly-pan does suit the bike and give it a street fighter kind of look. I was never a pulsar fanboy but the performance of this bike really impressed me and more power and the presence of 6th gear really gives it an edge over its competition.Coming to servicing, i guess all of us face this issue with each brand's service station that the guys working there are not at all literate about the bike and these manufacturers really need to work in this department. But apart from that i'm not really fascinated by the work these guys did in the 1st servicing. I had issues with idling, vibrations and some noise from the lower front part of the bike and out of it only idling issue was solved by them. And one more thing, they don't even dry the bike after washing and that was really annoying as i myself had to use a cloth to remove water from bike.I heard a-lot of people saying that there will be a quality issue with bajaj and i think to some extent they were right as the plastic of the bike really feels cheap and the other bikes in the competition really have edge when it comes to fit and finish. Also i'm facing an issue regarding acceleration above 5k rpm. When bike is above 5k rpm and when i accelerate, there is a pause and then the bike accelerates. So i think i will need to go to service guys again :(So overall i am really satisfied with the bike as it is really good in commutes and provides mileage around 40kmpl which is pocket friendly as well :)So if you are looking for a bike in a tight budget that can commute and do highway cruising in lower triple digit speeds easily, i would suggest you to go with this bike.",6 years ago,5,3,5,4,4,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,No Tips,12,3
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Great bike,"The power and torque figures remain unchanged with 24.5hp at 9,500 rpm and 18.3nm at 8,000 rpm, respectively. The liquid-cooled, single-cylinder unit continues to be mated to a six-speed gearbox. In terms of performance, the ns200 continues to be a punchy and enjoyable bike to ride. The gear shift is crisp and precise, with a clutch that is easy to use. The gearing is not too short, reducing the frequency with which you need to shift ratios. In sixth, going flat out on Bajaj's chakan test track, we managed to hit about 128 km/h on the speedo.The twin-spar pressed-steel frame continues to lend the bike admirable composure on straights and around corners. A low centre of gravity and well-centered mass facilitates confident lean around corners, aided also by MRF zapper tyres.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,5 Yrs of 200ns ownership review(2012 model),I bought this as my second choice my 1st choice was to buy bullet due to its high maintenance i backed out from buying bullet.But i'm happy because it was mostly trouble free owning this bike apart from minor issues because i travel lot in alone to a long distance but it never let me down on my long trips only problem i faced is that loosening of chains frequently it is still unsolved i think that will be the case for most of the owners.Another improvement needed in seating department because it is very hard and cannot ride long stretch without taking a break.That must improve otherwise touring will be little difficult.Braking is not good i thought may be of bad quality stock tyres but after trying another one it still not improved i had completed over 45000kms.That will be a problem while riding in wet and muddy conditions.Seat height is little high and will give problems for shorter riders bajaj should have taken into account that indians are average in height so they could have reduced the seat height.Service and maintenance are economical compared to other brands of same specs.It is a complete package and value for money it gives decent mileage of over 40kmpl which pretty good compared to other brands and even some 150cc bikes are giving only that much mileage.Its cornering abilities in ghat roads are amazing.It is a good package for this money and this review is entirely on my personal experiences.,7 years ago,5,5,5,3,4,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,Proper service is mandatory otherwise it will give you unwanted noises,10,1

It's turning radius will make a difference but you will get familiar of it. The power is endless. It gives you a nice mid range and top range. This is the most capable 200cc bike. The bike still looks like a demon to me.I've ridden Apache 2004v for a long time, but ns200 makes a lot more sense as compare to Apache.

The mechanic only cleaned the carburettor and told me there is no other issue with the bike and i was happy. But same thing happened next day itself. I asked him what is causing the issue, he was unsure and told me to replace carburettor. After changing the carburettor my bike stopped running after 3 days and then again i have to take it to service centre.

What i felt if i apply the front disc brake then it automatically puts pressure on your thighs to hold your body back and after riding few kilometres it starts to pain.Another thing is that this bike has 6 gear box so if you are riding in city then you have to shift gears a lot and again your left portion between left knee and ankle starting to pain.After all this, let me end by saying i love this bike.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,"REVIEW AFTER 20,000 KMS",Buying this naked beast was my dream. When Bajaj Re opened the sale of ns i booked one. The Bike is a VFM product (value for money) For a price range of under 1.3 lakh you can't have a bike like this . 199.7 cc 23 bhp power and strong top end performance . uff you will love it after owning one (y) . Fits me for all type . long rides Can be irritating for the first time for a few time after all you will be comfortable. getting a seat cover with soft padding will increase comfort. I'm getting a mileage about 38 and above for long rides and 30-35 some what in city conditions. Do Lube it for 400 km or the chain will start making noise clean the Sprocket too. The stock eurogrip (actually it's euroslip ) tyre is not worth for this bike . some how I rid a 16k km on it . That's what a problem for me . Now MRF NYLOGRIP ZAPPER is being available as stock.

I can say that this bike has 200cc with best performance and this motorcycle is at the top place. When I used to ride this bike it felt very good due to stability, due to the framework and swingarm at high speeds also. I personally own sparking Black pulsar ns200 bs4 which gives very good amount of power and torque which present in it. My bike cost around 1500 rupees for every service and maintenance which is also very easy for this bike. Pros of this bike is its looks, performance, stability, liquid cooling system, comfort, which is not that expensive too. Cons are like this bike has USD forks because it really deserves it, and its super wide tyres at rear section which gives much more confidence on cornering. which are missing in this bike but although we can manage with the stock tyre present in this bike.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Bajaj pulsar 200ns -  experience,"The bajaj pulsar 200ns, was how the motorcycle was known when my brother first bought it in august 2012. It was a welcome addition to the pulsar family which changed the mindset of many Indians about bajaj auto pvt ltd. The engine of the 200ns is derived from the ktm duke 200, tuned so as to satisfy the needs of a daily commuter. This review is going to be divided into two parts. Part 1:My brother's experience (august 2012 - august 2014 / 0-16000 kms):He was in the search of a motorcycle when he was studying in college and he finalised on the pulsar 200ns(cherry black), which was the latest motorcycle on the market at that time. Buying the motorcycle went smooth and was hassle free. The on road price in Chennai at that time was approximately inr 1,00,000. He followed the soft-break in method to set-in the engine and did the servicing as per the manual and didn't experiment new things with the motorcycle. Thus for the first 16000 kms the motorcycle was bone stock and didn't give and problems at all. One problem he faced was the coolant leaking, which was fixed when he took it to the service centre.Part 2:My experience (august 2014 - present(July 2017) / 16000-40040 kms)I got my hands on the motorcycle when i joined college and my brother left abroad for pursuing higher studies. Me being hyped getting a motorcycle was ""squiding"" for my first few kilometres on the motorcycle. That was until i met with an accident just one month after getting my hands on the pulsar 200ns. The fault was on my side and was not on the motorcycle. After this event, i started riding with proper gear(at least a helmet at all times) and started to respect and bond with my motorcycle. This was the time i learned to actually ride a motorcycle properly. I replaced the motorcycle's chain sprocket at 20,000 kms and started to experiment new things. So far i've used the motul 5100, 7100 and 300v engine oils in my motorcycle and i would recommend motul 7100 20w50 over the other two. I used motul 7100(fully synthetic) as an upgrade from the stock bajaj mineral oil. The motorcycle felt real good after this change and i felt like the exhaust note of my 200ns also changed a bit. After that i tested out motul 5100(semi-synthetic) and it was disappointing. So i moved to the higher end motul 300v(fully synthetic) which i'm using currently. I feel like motul 300v for daily commutes is a overkill. So that's the reason i recommend the pocket friendly motul 7100. The drain interval for motul 7100 would be anywhere around 7500- 8000 kms. Apart from changing the engine oil, i also changed the brake and clutch levers to moxi shorty adjustable levers. The stock levers were fine, but they broke when my 200ns had a fall when it was parked in a school zone. The tyres i'm using currently on my 200ns are mrf zapper fx1(front) and ceat zoom xl(rear), soon planning to change to continental contigo in the rear. I'm also planning to revert back to motul 7100 and change to rs200 sprocket set, since it's time to change the sprockets on my motorcycle. I've tested my 200ns and found the following:1. Mileage : (a) riding calmly(below 6k rpm) - 38 kmpl(b) riding with little aggression(6k-8k range)  - 34 kmpl(c) pushing the limits(shifting at 9k or 10k rpm) - 29 kmpl (note: once you get into motorcycling, you won't care about mileage)2. I did not face and over heating issues with the motorcycle. The cooling system does it's job.3. My pr on the motorcycle is 159 kmph. First gear tops at 54 kmph.Pros:1. Has enough power in the city.2. Looks fresh even now.3. Value for money.4. Braking and cornering abilities are good.5. Torque delivery is linear, which is good for beginners.6. Good mileage.Cons/areas of improvement:1. The seating posture is upright, but the seat gets uncomfortable after riding for 40 kms and also knees feel cramped(i'm 6' tall).2. Touring in the 200ns is something i'm not a fan of. You can cruise at speeds of 90 kmph, but the engine starts to stress a bit over speeds of 105 kmph. 3. The crash protectors/leg guards protect the motorcycle during accidents, but they break and the screw gets stuck inside the thread which makes it difficult to fit a new crash protector.4. Stock eurogrip tyres were pretty bad. The mrf zappers are far better.5. Vibrations post 6k rpm, though they don't bother me that much.Verdict: If you are on the search of a motorcycle in the price range of 1 lakh rupees, you can't go wrong with the bajaj pulsar 200ns. Choose the one with mrf zapper tyres because there are motorcycles which are being delivered with eurogrips also.P.S: the problem with these 200cc motorcycles is that after sometime, they start to feel under-powered(at least for the highways). So if you have the money, i would suggest you to go with a higher capacity motorcycle(say 300+cc motorcycles).Ride safe! and remember... ""ride only as fast as you have it under control"".

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Honest review after 2000 km,The buying of ns 200 is the dream coming true of owning a beast in first 500km the bike will give you all happiness regarding to company setting refinement but after the 1st service it got lot of vibration on the mask section but it can be compromise by using the motul lubricants while the service of bajaj udaipur is not at up to the mark so for bajaj udaipur a big thumbs down while for average I had tuned the carburettor for better mileage on my own now and i use speed or power and sometimes extra premium petrol for good mileage and in city bike gives me 32kmpl and on highways 42kmpl the suspension are on stiffer side so for long rides they are supper best but while commuting in city they are little bite hard to go from potholes they are not up to the mark but you can just stand on their footrest and go through them so that you cant get jerks now coming to the looks it is naked as the name is given naked sports 200 it is ultra light ultra confidence giving bike to twisties and at the top speed of 150 kmph.,5 years ago,5,5,4,1,5,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,3-6 months,please use motul lubricants for lesser vibrations .,6,0

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,You will never regret buying this beast,"This is my first bike. I understood the importance of having a bike during lockdown period and decided to buy a bike. Tvs apache rtr 200 was my option but tvs showroom guys were not willing to bring a 200cc bike to khammam where I live. I casually went to bajaj showroom and ended up booking this bike. It’s a black ns 200. Comes with 6 gears and it’s fully justified. Run on the highways you will know the potential of this beast. I have done khammam to Hyderabad many times. The amount of adrenaline I experience on suryapet highway is unexplainable. It’s very comfortable to ride as it comes with clip on handle bars. I get 27-30 km/l I guess, I do 100, 110, 120, even crossed 130 km/h on this bike. But it does have few cons. Pillion seat is not comfortable for ladies. This is not for moms. You will enjoy the ride if your have a girlfriend. Pure riding fun is when you ride it solo. Another problem I face is this bike doesn’t have ladies foot rest. 160 comes with ladies footrest but they don’t give it on 200 ns. Right after buying this bike it was submerged in flood water in Hyderabad. Got it repaired from a mechanic and it runs like a beast.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,"Adrenaline Booster , Feel the Power","Experience - I had purchased this bike on 20th Dec 2017 , till now I have rode this bike 7.5k km . Ns200 is best among other 200cc to 250cc segment in terms of reliability , mileage , comfortable , daily commute , maintenance , night drive , Touring as I have personally experienced those things . Mileage , Suspension - I have to travel 100 km to 150 km regularly for 3 to 4 days every week for my construction sites in my area which is rural area , and I am so impressed with Ns200 suspension setup which are awesome ... when I came home at evening it didn't feels like I have driven such 100 km long ride , its like bike is calling me to hop again  ready to go . About mileage , what we expect from 200cc bike  Its pretty good that its gives nearly 35km/l to 38km/l . I am always filling 10L of petrol and check as bike came up on reserved , and then odometer sometimes shows between 340 km to 370 km , so Yes we can say bike gives pretty good mileage at least 35 km/l , I am riding my bike under 50 km/h to 80km/h speed criteria .  Maintenance - Its been 2 free servicing I had , first on 500 km and second on 5k km . Those are free but we have to pay for Engine oil , oil filter . In free servicing they wash bike , change Engine oil , change engine oil filter and done . Its been 7.5 k km and bike didn't gave me any trouble about maintenance , so far so good . Overall review - 1. In 200cc segment , this bike gives pretty decent milage . 2. Engine refinement is awesome , I mean I almost check for Engine is running or not . You did not feels any vibrations between 70 km/h t0 120 km/h as I had experienced during my tour days . Bike feels just strainless between 70 km/h to 90 km/h  . 3. Best buy 200cc bike in 1 lac with liquid cooling , which not everyone offers . 4. Mirror are very good , tyres are doing best , no skids if you properly apply breaks .5.  Headlightight is not issue on night because it provides pretty big area to see . 6. Only issue that boot space is very less so I have to install resting bag for carrying my documents , things with me . 7. Pillion seat is also nice . I have went on Tour with pillion like 500 km and return . We don't feels any issues about comfort seating . 8. Ns200 has distinct looks , its eye catchy design make me fall love with her .

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Personal advice to buy ns 200,"Many people review bikes, i don't know how to do that but i would like to share my 5 years of exp, with my bajaj ns200, i call it bumbleb. When i was studding mba my dream was to own a bike, i mean who's not. Earlier i used to ride my papas super splendor. I live in khandala, not a lonavla-khandala, it's on the way to mahabaleshwar, just before a khambataki mountain pass. My college was in pune, so the distance is 60km, so 120km of daily commute. I was a big fan of ktm duke 200,newly launched but problem was that they had limited showrooms and i was unable to find one for me in our area. I thought bajaj distributes ktm bikes so i visited nearest bajaj showroom, asked for ktm and they introduced me this black beast ns200, my papa insisted me to buy that one, but my mind was still on duke...And somehow that sales guy and papa convinced me to buy... Thats what append with sam in transformers when he first meet his bumbleb and was not so excited very much.... To be continued...1.Buying exp - finally bobby (a sales person) sold me that bumbleb on 2nd day, bajaj guys are very nice and supportive till date so sales and after sales service both are bang on for me. And my rest of the journey begun. Till date didn't ride ns200 nor any other bike in same class with a sporty sitting posture. I used to ride only 60-70km/h. On third day i took my bike to the college with my friend nikhil. Naked sport or a street bikes were not much popular 5 years back as of now so i didn't get major attention to the bike which i could had gathered with orange ktm so was still unhappy... To be continued 3.Riding exp. - i don't know its a superstition or truth, some of my friends told me not to ride bike above 70km/h speed till it crosses atleast 3000km, so i followed the tradition to keep avg speed of 80-90km/h, cos bike has a 6 speed gear box it stalls at lower rpm's and i was irritating to shift down everytime at low speeds, i was getting adapted to the riding skills which are required to ride these kind of heavy bhp machines. One day nikhil and me were going to college as a daily commuter, we were busy in our talk and suddenly one r15 squid passed with very high speed. Nikhil simply asked me in a joke that weather i can catch them or not, i said let's try it out, i dropped a gear... Pulled a throttle and o boy... My daily commuter transformed into a race machine.... I crossed 120km/h... 135km/h...148km/h... I was still looking for r15 guys and they were still struggling to cope up . . . That feeling was so prod full . . . After that day i started loving my bike like crazy . . . After completing mba i used my bike for job...Weekend rides...Off road rides...Heavy rain...Deep potholes...To race with squids...Sometimes with semi pro riders...And believe me it never lets me down in any ride...To be continued...4.Looks,performance- looks like a bull from front side...Very aggressive... Very compact from back side... Petal disks add more beauty, there is very much room for graphics . . . Speedometer is nice, performance is balanced, commute or race it does its job pretty well ... It does justice to naked sports category...To be continued 5.Servicing and maintenance - service cost is very less, just 1000-1200 bucks, i have just changed chain sprocket once, treys once, break pads twice, clutch cable once in 65000km... Mileage is very good at around 38-40km for mixed ride conditions i.E city+highway at a speed of 90-120km/h and it is constant for all 5 years, no drop in mileage. 6.Pros - for me speed, comfortable riding position, mileage and a maintenance cost 7.Cons - slight power lag in recent 2018 rides, wind blast, seat is very hard, specially in summer, chain looses frequently, can be seen in all bajaj bikes.8.Conclusion - this is my first bike and it's like a wife, the more you spend time with her more you know her, in first glance u may dislike her but day after day she will amaze u with her skills.... Love for ever... M not going to sell my bike.",4 years ago,5,4,4,4,4,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,6 months-1 yr,No Tips,5,0

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,The perfect all rounder.,"We bought the bike 3 years ago and the showroom was very helpful and kind and insightful. The bike has been a bliss to ride ever since it came out of the showroom. The 200cc engine is very responsive to throttle, yet it is very tame and is perfect for a beginner rider. Have completed over 12,000 kilometers on the motorcycle, with primary use being commuting to and from college, with occasional weekend rides. It's looks are honestly one of the best looking in its segment, looks very muscular and curvy, I have purchased the white color and honestly it is gorgeous. We have installed a couple of modifications, like bar end mirrors, and hazard lights. The handling on the motorcycle is very smooth and controlled, and the power delivery is just perfect. It has a liquid cooling system which is just amazing and so helpful in traffic as the engine doesn't heat up too much and cools down relatively fast. Maneuvering and cornering on this motorcycle is also very fun and feels safe when we do so. The first 3 services were free and after that regular service every 6 months was done and the experience was good enough. Extra parts of the motorcycle were not available at the time of its initial (bs iv) release but now it's parts are in stock and can be purchased at reasonable price. Regular monthly washes, and driving the bike safely will not warrant any issues in it, but if it's not maintained and is driven rash expect loss of torque and vibrations on the contact points of your bike. The motorcycle is really good and there is an option of abs too. I don't believe there are any cons other than the vibrations which are the lowest in its segment, because the engine is very refined and reliable. The clip on handle bars are also a plus, as they give an aggressive look to the motorcycle but are also very comfortable. Definitely recommend a test drive of this motorcycle because it's a top pick in its segment.",3 years ago,5,5,4,5,4,Everything,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,"Regularly get all the fluids checked at each service, and make sure to try and replace the springs and small parts after a long term use.",5,0
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Style over speed.,"In 2012, when it was at its best and still relatively unknown to the riding community, we purchased a pulsar ns 200 bs3 variant. I use this bike for my daily commute. Great power delivery and good stability, and is worth buying a bike. The looks of this bike are really nice and have caught everyone's attention to date. Perfect 200-cc bike for daily commutes, long rides, and touring. It requires time-to-time servicing because it is a machine with low maintenance costs. Its main pros are that, unlike other bikes, this bike is perfect for daily commutes because of its ride height and seating position, making a rider comfortable and a pillion rider too. But its cons are that the bike is quite a heavy machine if this bike falls, it is very difficult to lift it up. But overall, this bike is like an all-rounder.",1 year ago,5,4,5,4,5,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,5,0
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Lean and mean street fighter,1. The buying experience was hassle-free. had to wait for 3 days for the cocktail wine red variant.2. When it comes to riding experience this motorcycle is easy to maneuver in city traffic and due to USD forks handling has been improved.3. The main reason I considered buying this motorcycle is because of the performance. Once crossing 5k RPM you'll feel the power of this motorcycle.4. Maintenance is very affordable as Bajaj accessories are cheaper and have wide service network.Pros:1. High-revving engine with good top-end punch2. Braking has good bite with dual-channel ABS3. Handling of the motorcycleCons:1. The seat is on the firmer side. 2. The fit and finish of the motorcycle need to be improved.Verdict:     If you are looking for a motorcycle under 2L with good performance then this is the best motorcycle.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Bajaj Pulsar NS 200,"Design and Build QualityThe NS200 sports an aggressive and muscular design that immediately stands out. Its sharp lines, edgy tank shrouds, and aerodynamic profile make it visually appealing. The dual-tone color schemes add to its contemporary look. The build quality feels robust, with high-quality plastic and metal components ensuring durability.Engine and PerformanceThe heart of the NS200 is its 199.5cc, liquid-cooled, single-cylinder engine, which delivers an impressive 24.13 PS of power at 9,750 rpm and 18.5 Nm of torque at 8,000 rpm. The Triple Spark technology enhances combustion efficiency, resulting in a lively performance. The engine is paired with a 6-speed gearbox, offering smooth and precise shifts. The bike accelerates briskly, reaching 0-60 km/h in under 4 seconds, making it one of the quickest in its class.Ride and HandlingThe NS200 is built on a perimeter frame, which provides excellent stability and handling. The front telescopic forks and rear mono-shock suspension are well-tuned, offering a good balance between comfort and sportiness. The bike handles corners with confidence, and the MRF tires provide ample grip. The upright riding posture, along with a well-cushioned seat, ensures comfort over long rides.Braking and SafetyEquipped with a single-channel ABS, the NS200 features a 300mm front disc and a 230mm rear disc, delivering strong and progressive braking performance. The ABS system prevents wheel lock-up during hard braking, enhancing rider safety.FeaturesThe NS200 comes loaded with features such as an underbelly exhaust, digital-analog instrument cluster, backlit switchgear, and LED tail lamp. The instrument cluster provides comprehensive information including a speedometer, tachometer, trip meter, fuel gauge, and clock.Fuel EfficiencyDespite its sporty performance, the NS200 manages a respectable fuel efficiency of around 35-40 km/l, depending on riding conditions.

Its competitive pricing further strengthens its appeal, making it one of the best options in the 200cc segment.This review highlights the strengths and potential drawbacks of the NS200, providing a balanced perspective that could resonate well with readers and contest judges alike.",14 weeks ago,5,5,5,5,4,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,"1. Regular Maintenance
              
        •  Service Schedule: Follow the manufacturer- 
             recommended service schedule religiously. 
             Regular oil changes, filter cleanings, and 
             spark plug checks are crucial for maintaining 
             engine health.
        •  Chain Maintenance: Regularly clean and 
             lubricate the chain. A well-maintained chain 
             ensures smooth power delivery and extends 
             the chain and sprocket life.
        •  Coolant Check: Since the NS200 is liquid- 
             cooled, regularly check and maintain the 
             coolant level to prevent overheating.

2. Riding Techniques
              
          •   Smooth Throttle Control: The NS200 has a 
                responsive engine. Smooth throttle inputs 
                will help you control the bike better, 
                especially in traffic and cornering.
          •   Gear Shifts: Use the 6-speed gearbox 
                efficiently by shifting at the right RPMs. 
                Avoid lugging the engine at low RPMs in 
                higher gears or revving too high 
                unnecessarily.

3. Tire Care
  
          •    Pressure: Keep an eye on the tyre pressure. 
                Incorrect tyre pressure can affect the handling 
                and fuel efficiency.
          •   Tread Depth: Regularly check the tyre tread 
                depth. Replace tyres that are worn out to 
                 ensure optimal grip and safety.",5,0

Buying experience- even though i made full cash payment, the dealership took more than 3 weeks to find a red coloured one. In the excitement i didn't do a right pdi by a technically sound person because they didn't have red in stock n finally found 1 some dealership in karnataka. I had to go through a lot of issues from the beginning because of defective parts on the bike for example,the clutch housing was not of good quality which resulted in lot of vibrations and too much of engine sound. Asked for a bike replacement but they refused as it was already registered in my name. It went for a certain time.....2. Riding experience - bike is a good handler, good braking, good for long rides and comfortable in city commuting as well.3.Performance - powerful engine, good torque, good pickup. Good mileage for a 200cc engine (40km/lt) average of city commuting and highway touring.4. Service & maintenance : bajaj vehicle spares are pretty cheap because of which quality is very bad , low life , less reliable.My bike has some issues with alloy wheels and engine casing powder coat chipping now. 5. Final verdict - i bought it in 2013 and have ridden it for 21000km till now in various terrains and highway rides.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Ns200 the feeling of not owning her but eager to..,"Its an awesome bike where i started to admire it 6 years before.Where i have no good financial status to afford this bike.But i waited long long admiring this bike alone what ever the new bike new model came i admired her(ns200) alone.After finishing my college i started for going to job there a friend of mine owned this bike for that reason i became friend with him.I borrowed his bike for a ride from chennai to pondicherry.It was in an excellent condition.I drove it smoothly and started to move in second gear and shifted third gear and my heart started beating wow "" living in dream "".Then i shifted fourth and moved around 40kmph and shifted 5th then raised rpm to 7000 with a scream in it the shifted to final 6th and flew away at 100 to 127 kmph at my best.What a experience was it driving with full safety precautions with out no disturbance to any public as it was Sunday afternoon.Look of the bike was awesome that naked look gave an attraction to the bikePerformance basis rating it with 5 i will surely give an 8 for the performance.Servicing i do not own a bike so i cant say but whatever since i love this i will be giving positive for servicing and maintenance in the sense she is my partner.Advantages is that the bikes naked body allows her to take a sudden pick up and reach a max speed of 127 within few minutes where any bike at this cost and this specs cant do that.Another advantage is that no silencer peaking out so that the curve bend can be performed on either side without disturbances.Disadvantages in it seems to be nothing :p.Thank you.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Pulsar 200 ns - the pocket rocket!!,"First things first! why did i buy pulsar 200ns?Well, frankly speaking i have been a pulsar fanboy since it's initial pulsar 180 launch, when i was just in class 10. Always wanted to own the greatest model pulsar had to offer. Back in 2014, ns200 was the flagship bike from bajaj and was on top of my list of buying options.I did test ride the royal enfield thunderbird 350 as well, but it's lack of initial power punch and handle vibrations drifted me away from buying it. As i was quite new to biking, such a heavy bike was not the right choice anyways.Coming back to ns,  i would like to start with the looks first!This bike is a looker for sure. It grabbed loads of attention for a good 6 months after my purchase. Many people at the traffic signals inquired me about this bike. Even cbr 250 owners. I heavily enjoyed all the attention that my bike used to get from people around. And fyi, i was riding it in hyderabad, not a small town with lesser bikes and low end commuters. It's a definitive head turner. So full marks there.As far as the buying experience goes, it was smooth for me. I also got the option of bike pickup and delivery by the service center of the dealer from where i got it. So that's a plus too.From a riding experience and performance perspective, this bike is a hoot to ride. It's got loads of power, kicking in very early in the rpm range. It doesn't have great torque considering it's weight, so u need to work through the gears in traffic. But it's not bad either. I am able to ride in 3rd gear at a speed as low as 18 kmph, and accelerate from there pretty quickly.Pusars have always been known for their pickup and this one is no different. It's a blaze. U don't need to twist the throttle much to get the punch. Even a quarter twist will do.Adding to this, the handling of this bike is amazing. Though it weighs 145 kgs, u will not feel it heavy at all while riding. It's very easy to handle and obeys your moves well. The suspension setup is balanced, a bit on the softer side on the front.The breaks are bang on and both the disk brakes do a good job.  Saved me a couple of times. Usually the rear disk breaks are not that powerful in this segment of bikes but the ns has got very good one, with decent bite.I have owned this bike for 3 years and 16k kms now, and the mileage has remained pretty stable. 32-35 in city and 38 on the highways.The bike is fun to ride on highways, particularly if you are riding at around 7000 rpm in 6th gear. It usually has high vibrations in the 5k to 7k rpm range but evens out out beyond that. Moreover the engine stays cools, thanks to the liquid cooling and radiator fan. It never burned my legs.Loads of bragging done about the bike. Now some pain points:1. Needs regular maintenance otherwise the vibrations increase and the carb gets detuned2. You may face coolant leakages3. Vibrations, not gud for people who are used to calm engines like the yamaha r15 or the hondas. Heard that the new ns bs4 version is much smoother but i have not tested that.4. Tyres. Please consider changing them to soft compound tyres (pirelli, mrf rev c). Euro grip tyres are durable but poor on road grip. So after all the gyaan, stuff that matters! who should buy this bike?A. Anyone looking for a bang for the buck while investing 1 lakh on a bikeB. Someone who cares about raw power, acceleration and looksDefinitely not for people looking for a super refined and calm engineSo the bottom line is, simply go for it if you don't have the budget for rs200/duke 200/r15.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Ns2000 abs 5 month experience,"1:- i bought it for rupees 1.35 lacs inr in 2019. Which was not very much as the performance and features it offered.2:- the riding experience is the best in class comparing this particular machine with its rivals.To be frank its the most powerful engine in 200 cc segment in India right now and also has the maximum torque and power output on offer.3:- looks wise, i bought it on my birthday on 18th oct 2017 which also happened to be the dhanteras. I was at cloud nine looking at this beast in the showroom and immediately i decided at the very first glance that i wanted it desperately.4:- it's low on maintenance too, though many a stores can't properly service this bike.5""- pros :it's insanely fast with 6 speed transmissions and delivers the best top speed of 150 kmph in 200 cc segment.The engines meanwhile loves being revved at higher speeds and the stability is awesome.Cons:it's didn't have abs in the previous version of 2017 but now in 2019 it gives a single channeled abs. Which i don't think is fair with such a powerful beast. I think the bajaj should give it a proper dual channel abs.Mileage being the second con but you can't expect mileage from a performance machine, it gives around 28 kmpl in city and on highways around 35 kmpl.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Pros & cons,"Pros and cons from my point of view. This bike is awesome i reached the top speed of 148 km/h.But it’s vibration is too much but this bike is better than r15 cbr150 and p220f. I have done 6000 km on the 200ns. Here are my views:Pros:Superb power. The pickup is excellent. The bike purrs and i have frequently crossed 130kph. Beats the p220 in a race.The design is super. Great contours. Imo it looks really sexy.The panel is ok. Serves its purpose.For a 200 cc bike the mileage of almost 40 is excellent.Great price.Good looking, well equipped, packed with exhilarating performance and handling.Cons:Bike is very heavy. Sometimes gets difficult to manage in heavy traffic.Unstable at high cross winds.Very small turning radius.Chain starts making noise after 5000 km. Needs frequent adjustments.No gear indicator on panel. Only shows neutral.Gears are hard and noisy.Rear tyre needs to be wider.Above 70 kilometre per hour it vibrates  very much i was little bit nervous after buying this bike because it was giving me a problem of chain noise & engine noise in clutch side. After services & using a best moto oil as same grad for engine lubricating. I have improved a noise & smoothness. I have reached a 153km/hr of scaring top speed. I got 38-40 kmpl of average in city. As u know its a street bike . Believe me guys its awesome above all street bike. No one other indian street bike can bit it.Even r15 & cbr 150 also nothing against it. Recently i m getting a 40kml of mileage and top speed of 153km/hr. If you are looking for best street bike in india its just awesome. If you will take care of your p200ns with best oil and time period of 2500km change. The oil & oil filter you will get more smoothness. And main problem of this bike is chain noise is so bad.But if u regularly lubricants it monthly it will reduced day by day.Those guys who are talking about no more speed & mileage please use motul oil for engine .Overall its nice options to choose bike.",5 years ago,5,5,5,5,5,Leisure Rides,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,9,6

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,The best vfm commuter bike available in india,"It was a careful consideration to go for this motorcycle especially after having tested the yamaha r15, honda cbr250r and honda karizma. The thing different with ns was its stance and the throttle response.It has been 5 years and more than 1,00,000 kms on this bike and there has not been any problem till date. The stance is upright which is very comfortable be it for local commute or long rides.Engine is a 200cc, liquid cooled unit with short stroke configuration which makes it a rev happy machine. You can almost relay the revs in each gear and the bike simply pulls away with ease doing a top sped of 155 kmph. Maintenance too is light on the pocket as neither the parts nor the service cost is too much. The biggest problem is when you decide to upgrade because after riding this machine you would have to go for something like an r3 or ninja 300 and only then it would be considered an upgrade.For less than 1,00,000 rs. This is the best machine you can buy which is decently powered, liquid cooled and has short stroke.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Ns 200 is it worth it!!,"So i have owned an ns 200 for almost 3 years now, it will be 3 years in November and in that span of time i have done 55000+ kms on the bike. To most of you reading this review it might be a surprise as i have done it in a short period of time but yeah that's me. So i have used the bike both as a daily commuter and a highway mile muncher. I have driven it in both north and south of the country and i have driven on good roads, bad roads to no roads as well.So talking about the bike, ns200 as it suggests is a 200cc naked bike which is a entry level sport bike on a budget in India. Pulsar being the favourite brand for young enthusiasts over a decade now it was an obvious choice. The bike houses as triple spark plug technology and the engine generated 23.5 bhp of power.The buying and maintenance experience of this bike has been very good for me. As a travel enthusiast the bike gives a good average of around 35 on the highway and 33 in the city, it is very cheap and easy to maintain and does not break down. I have never come across a ns breaking down in the middle of the road so far which gives a lot of confidence to the rider. The bike has a bulky look and heavy look and comes second to none in terms of styling yet it is not to sparkling if you are looking to gain attention. Overall a decent styling package and the best part it has just enough parts so the body doesn't vibrate or make noises.Coming to the performance aspect, in the city the bike is light and nimble so you can easily manoeuvre  through traffic and everyday use while on the highways doing 100+ the bike gives a planted and stable ride. The rear suspension is adjustable so it can be tuned according to the road condition and needs. On the highways the bike can easily do 100-120 constantly thanks to it's liquid cooling and can stretch upto 155 kmph top speed given that you are single rider. The only thing which might be an issue it the wind blast at high speeds. Since the bike is a naked one, post 120 you are bound to feel some wind blast especially is you are on the highway but given Indian riding conditions you are a fool to ride above that. Riding experience on the bike is very good as the seating is upright so you don't feel the pain in your hands or back. You can easily do 350 kms in a day on the bike if you are a new rider. For those who are intermediate or pro level riders 500-600 kms a day is also not an issue as i have done that distance in a day. The bike always feels planted on the road which gives lot of confidence and does not demand frequent cooling breaks either.Coming to the cons:1. Wind-blast. This is the biggest issue at high speeds on this bike.2. Eurogrip tires, the bike comes equipped with this tire which is not good for speeding. As soon as the tire heats up it loses some grip too.  This is one issue which can be resolved by changing tires and getting better ones.3. Rear seat. The rear seat on the bike is small and during long rides or long city commutes your pillion will complain of discomfort.Pros:1. Reliability. No matter how much you abuse the bike, it just doesn't give up and doesn't break down.2. Maintenance: you can maintain the bike for the first year at as low as 600 which given the bike and power is very cheap. After 1st year the parts are not expensive like the clutch plates cost only 700 to replace.3. Ride quality: nimble in the city, planted on the highway what more can you ask for.Due to the cons given above the bike has been rated 4 out of 5 because these are some areas where the company should improve. Do let me know what you think about it.But overall it's a worthy bike for it's price tag and you will not get bored of it if you're upgrading from a 150 cc category or if it's your first bike. It's good to ride, powerful, easy to maintain and home bred for reliability.",7 years ago,5,5,4,4,5,Tours,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,Use synthetic oil if you can use better tires like pirelli or michelin for fun lube the chain at every 500 kms use the front brake more as rear brake locks up is pushed suddenly,3,0

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,The bike for everyone and everything,"Ns 200 is best bike under 1 lakh so i think it's good for the costumer who is buying he's first bike. Because  the pulsar ns200 is powered by a 199.5cc, single cylinder, liquid cooled, 4-valve, 4-stroke, dts i  petrol motor producing 23.5 ps of power @ 9500 rpm and 18.3 nm of torque 8000 rpm matched to a 6-speed gearbox. Although the bike & specs remain unchanged, the ns200 is still superior in specs compared to the apache rtr 200. So bajaj hasn’t really tried too hard to fix what’s not broken. Power to weight ratio, ps/ton for the ns200 is 155 while for the new apache it is 135.The engine is now bs-iv complaint, so it has changed to the catalytic converter and gets exhausted gas treatment as well. The bike now gets secondary air induction with the exhaust gas also being sent back to the engine chamber through a small pipe, this is visible from the outside. Also, with the addition of bsiv, the engine cdi maps have been changed which are resulting in better air-fuel mixture, refinement, etc. When the as200 was launched, this 200cc motor was worked upon for better refinement, and all of that has now been carried over to the ns200 as well.The ns200 weighs 152 kg, so it is not really light, or particularly heavy. But when it comes to performing, it does. The bike has very good power delivery, and all in a linear fashion. Not explosive like the ktm sibling duke 200. Where the ns200 shines is the low end and mid range performance. It is just perfect for the city.",6 years ago,4,5,4,5,4,Leisure Rides,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,If you are giving monthly servicing it's good but change the oil after 750 km to 1000 km for your good,3,0

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Powerful 200CC Machine !! A worth buy !!!,"An amazing bike to buy. To be Frank NS200 don't need an ABS, because the Standard hydraulic brakes are only very good , but you should learn how to control it. Even in 70-80 kmph speed, the bike can be easily handled. Suspensions are very good, no back pain or such issues. Even looks are cool , I have almost completed 10k kms in span of 7 months. To share my words, it's was an amazing decision to buy an NS (Except from dealer). It even gives a good mileage of approx 35kmpl to 38 kmpl in city limits riding in and around 4000 rpm. Service cost is also economically viable, they don't charge you more than Rs.1000/- unless you complete 3rd free service. Overall a good experience to buy And Yeah, the main part is the vehicle is so strong, might be the front portion or the middle segment , the bike is so strong that it can bear the accident impact in 60 to 70kmph well .

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,"Ns200, the only bike you should buy if you have low budget and high expectations","1.I got this bike when pulsar 200 ns was newly having abs and i got it in very good price.2.Riding posture is very good you can easily ride it even if you are going on tour.Very good with mrf tyres. On the corners its very good because of abs you can easily ride and secured also.3.According to me looks are just unbelievable. Its one of the best bike you can take it to college, office and even in any occasion. Performance wise it is best in 200cc bike, average is also good in city as well on highway. So it doesn't hurt your pocket. Abs work very fine and securely.I have tried from 100kmph to 0kmph it was just an awesome experience. Engine cooling is also good fan stops automatically if engine comes under some particular temperature even when u are riding. So you don't feel heat on legs.4.Has company provides 4 services free in a year so you don't have to worry about it.Only the engine oil charges are taken from the customer and the maintenance is quite medium not so high not so low. Maintenance is also depends on bike owner if he regularly check all things and drive below 60kmph till 2nd service or 500km so the maintenance will be low and average will definitely increase.5.1.Pros:i will not say much about pros as you read all the above points it comes under pros.But believe me you will enjoy this bike riding. Pricing is also good.5.2.Cons: there's some certain cons about bike.Like company can provide dual channel abs as many companies are providing now a days.Cause because of single channel abs bike vibrates when you suddenly just apply front break..",4 years ago,No Design Rating,No Reliability Rating,No Comfort Rating,No Service Experience,No Value Rating,Daily Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,Earlier drive under 60 to 80 kmph to maintain bike health.,3,0
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Best performance is to price.,1. Buying experienceTo be honest the experience wasn't great. The showroom didn't have a test bike so I couldn't get a test ride. I bought it purely based on reviews.2. Riding experienceHandles like a charm and after 7000 rpm the bike flies. 3. Looks and performanceI liked the look more than the RTR 200. (purely subjective)Definitely pulls harder than the RTR 200 on the highway but in city traffic bike has to be revved hard for quick overtakes. No low end power and mid range isn't as strong as the RTR 2004. Servicing and maintenance.Well being a Bajaj the servicing is quite reasonable but would recommend not to get the standard Bajaj engine oil that they provide. They use the same engine oil for their CT100 as well.5. Pros and ConsPros being the suspension is amazing. Really irons out most bumps and bike is easily flickable in tight corners. Best performance in this price range.Bike flies after 7000 Rpm. Good for highway. 6th gear helps a lot.Extremely flickable in city traffic and very low turning radius.ConsTyres could be betterNo low end power and mid range isn't as great as the RTR 200 or Duke 200.No led turn signals like it's older brother the RS 200 and Duke 200.,4 years ago,5,4,5,5,4,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,Service the bike at regular intervals. don't use bajaj engine oil. maybe get better rear view mirrors and ride safe.,3,0

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,3,Pulsar ns 200 the highway monster assessment,"After months of taking accounts of numerous expert reviews, and owners reviews, videos and what not. I carefully selected to go with ns 200, my heart was aching for an apache, I've always liked apache to be honest. However, it was the mind that chose to pick ns, because why not, it has bajaj's reliability on availability of affordable spare parts and the service centers are almost everywhere challenging hero corps in odisha. buying experience The buying experience was alright, the salesman, somewhat disinterested, spoke less of the bike and more of selling the product by pointing out price rates, he didn't seem to mind when i confessed i'm considering to opt for either apache rtr 200 and the yamaha 250 as well, however in my mind I've already opted for the ns. I visited that place two days later to buy the bike. The showroom took about 2 hours to finish paperwork-- it was downright frustrating, i have a discover which i bought 4 years ago, they never took this much amount of time to finish the paperwork back then, but that was from another showroom. And not to mention the times i had to go back and forth for the number plates which were out of stock, they supplied the plates after a week; i was so angry that i was about to ask them to return the money-- cut from the price of plates, so i could buy it from outside. With the plates rightfully latched, i was out of their face. riding experience The riding experience is something that bothers me. I mean, yes, I've read it was on the stiffer side for both rider and the pillion-- the pillion is abominable so let's not talk about that, it's a sports bike after-all, so it gets a pass. I haven't ridden the ktm (the expensive sibling) because it was too pricey, so i cannot compare the riding quality of both regarding comfort and position. I was mentally prepared to handle the stiff suspension, but i got a surprise, the mono-suspension are very discomforting-- you will literally feel it through your spine if the bike hits any terrible road; however, the front forks are amazing it honestly cushions the jerks and snaps for your arms and shoulders. In conclusion the riding experience is somewhat so-so, with one side working really good, with another-- the mono, is somewhat okay as long as you ride in good roads. looks & performance The looks are dated but i find it attractive-- not only me, but most people share the thought i hear, keep it beside an apache, it'll still look majestic and terrifying good-looking, however, the apache has a severe case of fading body paint. Now, what really bothers me, the only thing that i find objectionable is the performance, because the bike grunts-- now hold on, i understand it's a sports bike after-all, but no, that is no reason for it to grunt. My friend owns the apache, it is definitely more fluid, smooth and suave of the two, you won't even notice the gear shifts in apache, and the exhaust note is mellifluous. Another problem i'm currently experiencing is downshifts, the gear just doesn't click when you downshift from the top to the bottom, it's recurring but not frequent. However, i think in terms of handling, the ns takes the edge, it's powerful engine and the grip of tyres is a marvel, it contributes to the confidence to zip through traffics without being terrified of hitting something--although i do find it unnecessary, because i don't propose people should be doing this in traffic for obvious road complexity because of other drivers and the chances of risks they carry. Performance wise, for not being a smooth city brawler, this bike is unquestionably a grunting highway monster. Hey, i'm getting a mileage of 40-42kmpl so i'm not complaining about the performance, but it should be more smoother for better riding experience.servicing & maintenance. The spares are cheaper, and the service center mechanics are fully conscious of what this machine holds, so no issues regarding the service and maintenance also i do believe it's too soon to speak about the maintenance. Can't speak for other states, but in odisha i think they work fine from my experience with them, how do i know? because i am also a proud owner of a discover 150.pros and cons. Pros: for me it is definitely handling because you can ride for hours comfortably without any pain in shoulders and arms, the bike is sturdily built, practical mileage, and the pulling power, also the sixth gear for highway.Cons: hard rider seat, stiff mono-shock suspension, terrible pillion seat-- it's punishing for the pillion rider, grunty ride, lack of foot rest on the saree guard, no kick-rod, also the sixth gear for city traffic.",6 years ago,4,4,3,3,4,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,No Tips,10,8

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Detailed Review,"1. Buying this bike has a story behind it...I was wishing to buy a second hand Pulsar NS200 but My dad said of new so when I headed to the showroom Pulsar NS 200 was out of stock in the city. On 22 December ,2017 I called my maternal uncle who called the showroom manager who himself got the bike from truck from 20 Kilometers away and Gave me the delivery of the bike of the Last lot that  came to Jaipur.2. Riding this bike is not a new experience for me ...... one of my Friend bought this bike in 2014 after launch and from very that day Pulsar became my Bae. While riding this bike you can actually feel the power. While if I compare with the rivals KTM Duke 200 and TVS Apache 200 V RTR  this bike has its own identity like on the top speed it is much likely stickey to road with a well balanced mechanism. Pickup is like its ready to fly.3. Let's talk about the looks first.  @ Aerodynamic Design and the body cuts make it look fabulous.  @ TailLight gives you a bombing experience of a Devil's Light.  @ Headlamp is just a Dashing match with the body and      makes a feel like a Beast is watching us.All over the looks and design is FabulousLet's talk about the Handling of the bikeHandling is the main issue regarding rides because as you lean and corner it require a major part of handling.No Doubt Leaning With this bike is a Great Deed while I did.But there is a bit Problem with the turning radius.Let's go to the seating arrangement....as we sit.on the bike it is quite comfortable for first 10 Kilometres but after that Hip Bone start resisting the seat so there is much requirement of more comfortable seat and as well as the pillion seat.Talking about the Digital Meter and Analogue part. No doubt the display is quite impressive but the part that disappoint the most is the fuel meter ...... fuel meter makes fun of riders. hahahahahaAll over the meter part is also awesomeTalking about the wheels I am really disappointed by the thickness of the tyre that Bajaj Shrinked it. As I have rode with the Old model It look much muscular and like a Naked Sport comparing New one but you we can manage that too by Getting new tyre to be installed .Engine part makes us feel too good No overheating issues got yet and listened yet.Radiator Fan works very fast cooling ...... though the fan works like a Eid Ka Chaand .There is bit problem with shifting the gears so look forward to shift them smoothly.Overall This Bike gave me every happiness while I ride .Loved This bike.Must Go For It.",6 years ago,5,4,4,4,5,Daily Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,3-6 months,Take Your bike after every 500 kilometers for a regular checkup to maintain all the parts and nuts and bolts to be tighten and for the better ride experience.,3,1

I was riding karizma zmr 2015 prior to this and once i hopped on it i felt the power bump immediately.This bike is great for long tours and city commute. Seating position is upright though seat cushioning is hard. Bike has great pickup and great top speed. Rear suspension is little on the stiffer side which gives u confidence on bumpy roads but exhaust you little. I am getting mileage around 35 city highway combined but its fuel gauge is not trustworthy sometimes it shows 3 points and in next restart it shows null. Tank capacity is though good around 420kms. Meter console is analogue digital with blue back-lit. Personally i prefer analogue rpm meter. Information on the meter is pretty limited. All basic information like fuel, speed, taco, side stand indicator, service reminder, trip meter etc. Are available.I have purchased dual disc variant(non abs)  and i must say it works impressively.Under belly exhaust sound is decent but not as bassy as it's closest rival apache 200 4v.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Great bike on decent price range,"Style  pulsar is the bike which redefined the style algorithm of two wheelers in india, same as the case with 200 ns also. A very bold statement against all other competitors in terms of design and styling. Engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox very good performance in highways and rural roads. I've been using this bike for the last 2 years and done 18000kms, no issues with clutch, gear box and engine. In terms of fuel economy, i am getting 43-44 on high ways and 40-41 on rural roads.   Ride quality & handling though the bike has a sporty looks, it doesn't give any reason for back pain on long highway journeys like some other bikes. Handling is very good thanks to the perimeter frame which allows us to lean more while cornering without fear. Back suspension could have better. Final words nothing to say bad, decent price for a sporty/commuter bike areas of improvement    1. After all it's a six gear machine, so there is a need for gear shift indicator, which is a must but this machine lacks. Though the display has a space for this, but bajaj has put a 'b symbol' there, don't know why?!! 2. Price band around 1 lac, but it doesn't have a proper display for right/left turn indicator, rather put a single bulb display for both the indicators.3. The stock tyres eurogrip is not recommended, try to replace with michelin or pirelli    pros1. Handling, 2. Looks, 3. Fuel economy, 4. Low maintenance, 5. The perimeter frame 6. The sixth gearcons1.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Ns200 a powerfull dual package bike normal  stunt in budget. 1 yr riding experience,"I know many people wouldn't be satisfying with my experience and disagree with it. But its genuine and based on personal experience after riding 18000 km with pulsar 200 ns.Buying experienceMy buying experience is never too satisfying as on the second day i noticed coolant leak  below the head  seal of the engine. It took new engine to be open and rearranged. Initially i was very disappointed by this product from bajaj. Although engine is also a machine and machine can be breakdown anytime be it on second day. But when i took my bike to long runs it respond amazingly and believe me i have never faced any problem ever.Riding experienceMy riding experience is very satisfying as i am from chandigarh and i hate to visit delhi-ncr 2-3 times in a month due to my personal reasons. It barely take 3 hours with my bike to reached gurgaon. Believe me i haven't felt any restless or backpain or other problem which most bikers are facing during long runs. Sometime i have to came back without any stop as i have to reach early. Details about looks, performance etc.The overall look of a bike is very aggressive and it provoke you with 23+ bhp to pull the trigger and go hard. Performance is massive in compare to other 200 cc bikes. I also have duke 200 but it feels very light weight in comparison to ns which automatically proves that ns is more reliable for lean and smooth run on overtakes. Engine is refine and exhaust sound is amazing after 130kmph speed. Nissin brakes and mrf pre-loaded tires gives you smooth running confidence with healthy stoppable power. I also use ns for stunting and its totally responsive as a stuntbike too. Servicing and maintenanceService and maintenance of ns 200 is not as easy as it looks. Initially i struggled a lot for getting spare parts after small accidents or stunt impacts. But nowadays its easier to maintain this bike. With specifications like this, maintenance cost of this bike is under everyone's budget who could afford ns200.Pros and consPros*best bike in the segment.*affordable maintenance.*affordable 200cc new generation bike.*best ever indian stunt bike.*appealing looks.Cons*normally felt heavy for normal people*color schemes for the bike.*not comfortable for every age group. *abs not available.",7 years ago,4,3,4,4,4,Everything,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,Don't compromise with servicing of the bike.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,All about my favourite machine the ns 200 !,"1. I bought it for rupees 1.25 lacs inr in 2017. Which was not very much as the performance and features it offered.2. The riding experience is the best in class comparing this particular machine with its rivals.To be frank its the most powerful engine in 200 cc segment in India right now and also has the maximum torque and power output on offer.3. Looks wise, i bought it on my birthday on 18th oct 2017 which also happened to be the dhanteras. I was at cloud nine looking at this beast in the showroom and immediately i decided at the very first glance that i wanted it desperately.4. It's low on maintenance too, though many a stores can't properly service this bike.5. Pros :It's insanely fast with 6 speed transmissions and delivers the best top speed of 136 kmph in 200 cc segment.The engines meanwhile loves being revved at higher speeds and the stability is awesome.Cons:It's didn't have abs in the previous version of 2017 but now in 2019 it gives a single channeled abs. Which i don't think is fair with such a powerful beast. I think the bajaj should give it a proper dual channel abs.Mileage being the second con but you can't expect mileage from a performance machine, it gives around 32 kmpl in city and on highways around 36 kmpl. That's all for now.But let me tell you that if you buy this machine, you are not going to regret in any way possible.",5 years ago,4,4,4,4,3,Tours,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,"1.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Naked wolf best bike under 2 lakhs,"The buying experience was ok for me because there were no bikes available in the bajaj showroom, first, I went to buy n250 which was not available in the showroom. Then I thought of buying d250(dominar)but that bike was also not available in the showroom, then I planned for mt -15 .Mt-15 was costing about 2.38 lakhs which I considered it was more for a 155 cc bike (ns price 1.82 lakhs). Then I had an option of ns200 so I bought this machine                   I think ns200 is the best bike under 2lakhs in terms of its power. The initial and mid-range are good but after the bike crosses 80 the bike will deliver its maximum power. The looks are also awesome but the main problem in the bike is the lack of features, like the main feature which is missing, is gear position indicator (the led light is also missing but that is not a problem for me)Pros:*top end is great * Performance* comfort both for rider and pillion* engine is advanced (6th gear,4 valve, liquid cooling) *ExhaustEct Cons :*lack of features* heating problem (it is a new bike so it heats fast i guess.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,The vfm motorcycle!!!,"Pulsar 200ns is one of the best vfm performance bikes in India. It was my dream bike and i owned it starting from 1.1.2015. I'll share my experience starting from buying to till now.The buying phase:When i planned to buy a bike in the middle of 2014, i shortlisted the usual ""mid-range performance"" bikes such as the apache 180,200 and others. But i was really interested in the design of the bajaj pulsar 200ns which stood out from others and was damn  hot-looking!! i started to research about it such as the features,prices,mileage & so on.I went to all the bajaj showrooms in the city and test driven the bike and there started my love for the bike. The buying experience which bajaj gives is not too good as they don't even care about their customers. Mine was not even washed and my speedo was not working when it was delivered. The service center guys repaired it later.The first 5000kms:First 5000kms is the crucial time for any new bike as it runs for the first time and it should be run at low rpm. I followed whatever mentioned by experts and by the instructions provided in the owners manual. I used to get a very good mileage of 43+ average. I followed the service intervals carefully and got it serviced at proper intervals. The bike was very smooth and created no problems at all. I was completely satisfied except for the eurogrip tyres which is the stock tyre for 200ns, it's a hard compound type tyre which has higher life but poor grip on dry & wet conditions.The later experience:The maintenance cost of owning a 200ns is seriously cheap when compared to the duke 200. After the first 5000kms the engine got a little bit of roughness and vibrations started to increase gradually. Xbhp forum helped me a lot with my doubts, i tried motul 7100 engine oil and it did a great job in reducing vibrations.Now i have driven 23000 kms and still no major problems have arrived. I changed the sprocket set recently which was the only major expense till date. I get a mileage of around 38+. If you like the bike, just go for it & it's the best in this price range.",7 years ago,5,5,4,5,5,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,Motuls 7100 synthetic oil is better than the usual bajaj oil.

The range my father stood is 1,00,000rs...Which i cannot own even pulsar....Thought a lot..Studied about bikes....Through internet..Tested on road..Both duke and pulsar.Vast differences.1.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Best pulsar yetas the catchline says....,"I have owned many bikes ,but this bike is really exclusive. Bajaj have come a long way from chetak to naked sport 200cc bike.One of the main reasons i chose pulsar ns is because it has lot of features packed in.First of all it is cheapest available 200cc category bike.The ns is equipped with first in segment triple spark technology  which is main reason of the enormous power it produces.It's liquid cooled for unmatched cooling of the engine.The chassis does provide a remarkable handling and stability even at speeds of 155kmph...Yes u read it right, on a stock bike u can hit speeds up to 155kmph( if maintained well).The engine has a pure raging power at the flick of the throttle. The brakes provided in the bike have a great stopping power.The brakes are just perfect for stopping the power output of the bike.Ride quality is upto the mark .Good for long rides and even city.The engine can also take abuses and it's smoothness is unchanged.It held to all the abuse that i gave it after changing to a bigger piston.I upgraded my engine by replacing a bigger piston and reboring.From the stock i upgraded to 78mm piston.After the change of piston i had the best power outcome.The bike easily made above 160kmph speeds.But unless u are not hp addict I don't suggest u swap for an aftermarket piston,Because the stock bike itself can do a great performance.Comes with a great tyres which provide excellent grip and unmatched cornering ability.Looks wise it just stuns people.It has the best looks. bajaj service centres provide pretty good service.But i prefer private garages.One of the cons is that its is little high for short riders and it weighs much too.Not much but it could have been 5kgs lighter.Other than that it's the best bike in market and affordable too.If anyone is planning on buying a 200cc bike i would recommend pulsar 200 ns.because it's worth for it's price tag......",7 years ago,5,4,4,4,5,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,"Maintenance is the only that's going to make your bike last long.Regular servicing and maintenance can cut down your owning cost.The most important thing to keep in mind is the engine oil,a good fully synthetic engine oil can keep your engine unharmed till u hit miles on the odometer(don't forget to change it every 3000kms or even sooner).
Regularly cleaning your chain and lubricating it for every 500 kms make it to last longer and I can feel a smooth ride.
Unless you have a healthy chain, you won't have any gear box problems.
And do not forget to use only unleaded petrol.Unleaded petrol prevents carbon deposits in your piston and engine head.
Unlike the normal petrol causes deposits of carbon which eventually damaged the bore  and cause u to replace the piston bore kit on a long term basis.",1,0

Cycle parts too are not as exotic or lightweight as the duke 200 but on a twisty road, the ns 200 can be as engaging to ride. In fact, the bike feels more relaxed and accommodating on the limit, something new riders will appreciate... Ride quality is good too though a tad on the firmer side going by the sporty demeanour of the bike... The mrf zapper tyres grip well in the dry and emanate a good level of confidence to ride the bike aggressively.. The 199.5 cc liquid cooled single is carburetted and tuned for mid-range grunt than top end whack. Strapping on our vbox equipment, we managed to get a 0-60kmph acceleration time of 4.86 seconds. The tvs apache rtr 200 4v (carb) manages to post a quicker 0-60kmph time of 4.02 seconds though the ns 200 is faster to the 100kmph mark, completing the 0-100kmph run in 12.58 seconds, ahead of the rtr 200's 12.94 second time. The quarter mile is covered in 18.35 seconds at a speed of 112.90kmph.The ns 200 is quick to rev and has a healthy shove post 5000rpm that remains unabated till the 9500rpm redline. The engine has enough grunt to pull away cleanly from as low as 30kmph in fifth gear. In-gear acceleration tests had the ns 200 covering 30-70kmph in third gear in 4.95 seconds while 40-80kmph in fourth gear took 6.57 seconds. The six-speed gearbox is slick and precise. We managed to clock a true top speed of 125kmph on the ns 200... In terms of fuel efficiency, the ns 200 managed to give 39.7kmpl on the highway and 36.1kmpl in city running conditions.. The performance cant explain in words.. Thank you bajaj for the excellent bike..",6 years ago,5,5,5,4,5,Everything,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,No Tips,1,0
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Powerful beast,"Bajaj is one of the most trusted motorcycle brand in India. Pulsar 200ns is a great sport bike provided by bajaj. In 95, 000 price we get a beast like a performance.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Complete review,"Comfort while ridingWider shape means that it feels bulkier and more muscular. Its thicker handlebar grips have an enhanced texture and reinforce the feel of control, despite it being a large bike. Riding the bike is simple and enjoyable: the overall seating position is predominantly upright, ideal for moving through city traffic, and the seat has been positioned higher in conjunction with a shortened wheelbase, lending it greater agility. The seat is solid but can feel a little too firm – you’ll start to notice it on long journeys.SuspensionAt the front of the pulsar ns200, there is 37mm telescopic front fork suspension with anti-friction bush. At the rear, the bike features nitrox mono-shock absorber suspension with a piggyback gas canister. The suspension shows its worth on rough surfaces – when you hit a bad patch, the bike manages to mop up most of the shocks and retain a smooth ride.BrakesThe bike’s brakes are decent and solid. At the front pulsar ns200 is equipped with 280mm disc brakes, and at the rear 230mm disc brakes. The bike’s braking distance from 60 to 0 kmph is 16.33 meters. The brakes perform well: a soft initial bite is driver-friendly, but the power comes into force with a harder squeeze, and when used the rear disc allows a significant degree of travel, making it easy to modulate its pressure.Ride and handlingThe pulsar ns200’s engine feels strong and punchy, and when moving through traffic it feels smooth and refined. It’s certainly quieter than any pulsar model seen before, except when pushed toward the top end of its acceleration – the resulting metallic grind as you approach it is redline is unpleasant. In dense traffic, the pulsar 200 is a quick, quiet ride that can twist and turn almost effortlessly. Leaning doesn’t feel too demanding, despite the bike’s bulk, thanks to its reduced weight and more spare chassis.Tyre sizePulsar ns200 is equipped with ten-spoke alloy wheels. The front tyre is a 100/80 x 17 inch, 52p, and the rear is a 130/70 x 17 inch, 61p. The bike does suffer considerably in wet condition – its tyres start to feel greasy and unstable, approaching a lack of grip that would be unsettling for any driver.ShadesIt is available in three shades: mirage white, wild red and graphite black. Bajaj recently introduced these 3 all-new shades for the pulsar ns200, which go really well with the design of the bike.Reasons to buy and value for moneyIt is a high-performance bike with a strong and capable chassis and excellent handling. Traditionally representing affordable performance, the new incarnation of the pulsar doesn’t disappoint, it is one of the best deals on the market.Pulsar ns200 is powered by a 199.5 cc, single cylinder engine is good for 23.17 bhp at 9500 rpm and 18.3 nm at 8000 rpm. The engine comes mated to a 6-speed gearbox. Ns200 weighs 152 kg and claims a top speed of 136 kmph. Bajaj autos silently relaunched the motorcycle as their was no official event for its arrival. A lot of fans were waiting for the ns200 but they would be disappointed to know that the bike is not equipped with fi and abs",6 years ago,4,4,4,4,4,Daily Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,Change of oil for every 2500 to 3000 km regularly get serviced and get a regular air check,1,0

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,My first love from bajaj,"Before buying ns i was an apache fanboy, had apache 180. Was sceptical about buying a bajaj product, as friends used to say bajaj makes cheap product, but man the day i brought my bike and rode it, it was sheer power, pure adrenaline rush. The bike is so well made and the balanced ride without vibrations made me love it from the first day. The ride on apache used to make by bones rattle to the core, but the smoothness in the ns's engine made me love bajaj more. The bike is comfortable for long hauls, minus the minor wind buffeting due to lack of wind visor. Still this is a great city bike and fun for weekend small rides. Love you bajaj for making such a great machine at an affordable cost.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Everything you need to know!,Important things first: Abs- there is a abs version available for few more thousands. Please go for abs it is extremely worth.You will thank me later in future.My experience with this bike and its abs feature is life saving. What is abs? Abs is anti-lock braking system.Now in very simple terms abs will basically reduce your chances of your tyres slipping  at a very greater extent.Looks? performance? Looks are 100% sexy. If you want a bike with good performance and best looks. This is the one. Service for 1 year is free but you still have to pay for the oil change as every other bike. It costs around 550 in Mumbai for oil change and the oil filter change at the first service which is compulsory.Pros:1. Sexy looks.2. Comfortable ride.3. Pickup is completely very strong.4. The throttle is smooth.5. Abs version available. (single channel).6. Value for money.Cons:The only 2 cons i find in this bike are 1. You don't get mrf tyres from the company. 2. It vibrates a little more as compared to other bikes after 4 to 5 rpm.Overall the bike is worth for money.  If you have a budget of around 1.30 then go for it. You will get the abs version within this price(on road) anywhere. And one more thing this bike is also called 'the naked wolf'.,6 years ago,5,5,5,3,5,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,3-6 months,"1.Do not be harsh with your new bike. Be like around 40 to 50 km/s till first 1000 kms or at least 700 i suggest.
This is the running period of the bike. If you be gentle with this period your bike will give you better performance in future in terms of mileage or top speed etc.
2. Check air pressure in the tyres every next week. This will help you in smooth rides and better mileage.
3. Don't wash it too frequently. Washing it during the service is enough. You can wipe with dry cloth every day and wipe with a little wet cloth and then a dry cloth like 3 times a week. Washing your bike too frequently may cause the bike to loose its shine.",1,0
Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Hot companion for a handsome rider,"the most attractive feature is the engine is  liquid cooled carburetor engine power is slightly less compared to duke 200 which is 23.7 ps and 18.3nm of torque . Ns200 has perimeter frame with mono shock at rear so for those who love cornering this bike for you. Also great machine on highway 6th gear helps for relaxed cruising at around 90-100km/hr with no stress on engine top speed that i have done on this bike is 138km/hr bike is very stable at this speed bike does 0-100km in less than 10 sec. Ns 200cc naked bike that you can get in Indian market at affordable price. With lots of advance features the only thing missing was abs but now they have added single channel abs.Mass centralization is very good because of underbelly exhaust. Its 200cc bike but bajaj have done good job to keep heat away from your legs in bumper to bumper traffic. Bike gives 32-35kmpl in city and on highway 40-43kmpl mileage if you are under 5000 rpm.The main advantage of   bajaj company is that  it has large service network. Also the bike service cost is less.Cons:-1) parts quality is much  good than previously done services. 2)smooth to handle, giving very comfort driving experience.3)no abs on/off button.4)underbelly exhaust makes it worry more when we go on large pothole.5)pillion seat is uncomfortable cushioning is not good seating feels uncomfortable for pillion on longer rides.",6 years ago,4,5,5,5,No Value Rating,Everything,Never Owned,No Data,Never owned,No Tips,1,0

For the roads in India and the traffic conditions, this bike is a superb option due to its handling and the flickability. But the seats could have been more softer for both the pillion and rider,it feels a bit stiffer.3. The looks of this bike are one of the best in this segment even if it's an old design.This design has been around since 2012 but still its looks very sporty and aggressive. Performance wise its a power machine. Once you reach higher rpms the throttle sound and the power changes dramatically and becomes very sporty.3.

They told we will give you helmet with this bike but later they refused then I fought with them then they bring the helmet. Then on the second day my bike started making noise from its front Tyre then i have to go back again they only have to open the front barring and greece that but instead of that they open whole system and then they started waiting for old staff to tell them what to do next. poor service. on my 1st service i told them front break lever is not working properly but they haven't did anything and charge for that also then what about warranty. Bajaj is making awesome bikes but service is getting down and staff is getting horrible. The coolant in bike is also very low they put and then they say it is like that but in my friends bike is more coolant from my bike.,6 years ago,5,4,4,1,5,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,ride safe and if any problem happen go to bajaj showroom if they refuse to solve the problem then email on bajaj official site then they will definitely solve your problem.,1,0

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Pulsar 200 ns  a giant leap ahead,"""sir, your bike has been delivered to the showroom. You can come collect it today."" the world's most pleasing words to the ears of a biker, my friend, who after nearly endless waiting and fantasizing since the booking date, felt extremely relieved and excited.It was time for my friend to meet the object of his riding desire. I and a couple other friends accompanied him to the showroom. After some wait, the bike made its way to the parking area of the showroom. What a sight! the beautiful saffron yellow 200 ns glistened under the twilight sun with the familiar cool blue back-lit switches complementing the vibrant tone of the bike. It reminded me of ""bumblebee"" from the transformers, as the elegant headlight gazed in our direction. Picking up a new bike from the showroom is always a memorable experience, especially with a bike as great as this.So, coming to the review, i have been fortunate enough to have spent considerable time riding the 200 ns (city and highway use) and developing my own perspective about the bike. I will try to cover all features and other things that have impressed me and my friends so far.As you approach the bike for the first time, the overall stance and design stand out. This is a bike that has been comprehensively designed, with subtle creases and slashes everywhere, giving it a sculpted look. When parked next to my 220f, it, surprisingly, looks much taller and larger. The headlight is shaped in the lines of a naked street-fighter. The tank is broad and meaty. The front forks are thick and sturdy, and the newly developed red mono-shock peeks from under the bike with its buddy, the gas reservoir, finished in dull gold. The tail section is wide and terminates with the familiar twin led strip tail- lights.Big grab rails surround the rather compact rear seat, accentuating the width of the tail. The tires have a larger, rounder profile. The paint quality has improved substantially from previous models. It has a particulate, almost glittering finish to it. The exhaust is an underbelly type, to reduce mass overhang and keep the overall center of gravity low. Overall, it is striking in appearance.As you sit on the bike, you get the feeling that you are perched way up and this gives you a good view over and around the bike. However, shorter riders may feel slightly nervous with this setup. The wide clip on handlebar is comfortable to hold, and the riding position is more street oriented rather than all out racetrack battle mode. The mirrors provide an adequate rear view.I flip the ignition switch, watch the digital/analog counters come to life, and thumb the starter. It thrums into life with a quiet attitude, which i thought detracted from previous pulsars and their growly, characterful engines. The throttle response is light and responsive. Pull in the light clutch, slot it into first (through a rather smooth, 6 speed gearbox) and off i go.First thing i noticed from the get-go, is that the engine is really smooth, vibe free and rev friendly. That, coupled with the short, closely spaced gearing, makes for a responsive and hard accelerating power plant. Power builds up strong and linearly from the bottom end of the rev range, with strong torque, and between 8, 000-10, 000 rpm, the bike's sweet spot, the exhaust opens up into a glorious scream and the bike rockets ahead. This is credited to the ns sharing the legendary ktm duke 200's aggressive bore, while having its own, patented, triple spark 4 valve head. Although this new engine head design sounds like overkill, it actually does work in the real world in offering a good economy/performance balance.Then a corner arrives. I grab the sharp and precise brakes, which offer tremendous bite, which effectively rein in my speed. Lean it in and it confidently turns in. ""what? a pulsar that actually likes corners??"" was my initial reaction. Special mention has to be made in regard to the chassis. Its an all new, twin spar, steel pressed frame (similar to the one on the masterful yamaha r-15), and it offers great levels of rigidity and performs impressively, giving the rider real confidence to corner hard, while being very maneuverable. However, the tires, which come as eurogrips, are pretty average, and kind of hinder the rider from fully exploiting the sublime chassis. When it comes to bumps and undulations, they are handled well and don't upset the ride quality of the bike.The 200 ns satisfies when it comes to running costs and fuel economy. This bike will deliver around 40+ kmpl, with combined highway and city riding, which is great for the performance it offers. Can it be due to the triple spark head? your responses are welcome.If i would have to criticize, it would be that the tires are a bit under-spaced for this bike. And it would be awesome if abs were offered soon for this model, as the brakes are quite sensitive and would certainly benefit from abs assistance. The engine note is a bit too quiet for my liking. Also, the pillion seat doesn't look that accommodating.Conclusion:I think bajaj have really pulled a masterpiece act this time round. Along with the explosive engine of the duke 200, combined with their proprietary head design, and the outstanding chassis development, they have revolutionized the pulsar lineage with this model. Refinement, build quality, riding dynamics, aesthetics and performance have been improved by no end. I do hope that the reliability will have also been improved. Only time will tell. This bike is an all rounder, and i hope to see more models with this level of consideration and engineering.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,There is a lot more to the pulsar 200ns than what meets the eyes,"1. Buying: buying pulsar 200ns was really the best decision i made back then and i never regret it.2. Riding: the pulsar 200ns never fails to bring a smile on my face. It's ride quality is something far more better than any bike of its class. I believe bajaj did make the most amazing naked sport in it class 3.Looks: well i would say she has the perfect blend of smooth body line and angular cuts here and there and as a matter of fact the pulsar stands out. It looks alot like a higher class bike.4. Performance: the 200ns is heavy and a bit tall so short guys like me need to be tip toeing at times but that's still quite ok once you get the hang of it. The bike handle like a say a 167kg play station. It would say it handles better than a duke 200 or the apache rtr 200. Although the pulsar is slower than the duke in terms up pick up and lack lil behind in power but then just rev her up and you feel all the 23.5 horse literally roaring. There are a few minor vibrations in the bike but it's quite less compared to the duke and apache. The bike feels quite planted into corners and can take a few bumps here and there with no issues. Although the stock eurogrip tyres were utter disgrace to the bike ( the tyres should be called euroslip instead of eurogrip) but then a quick change to mrf and the bike felt really good. It terms of touring on the believe it is the best bike our there for begin. You can literally throw anything kind of road at it and it will always handle it all like a hot knife slicing through butter. I mean the bike just keeps on going. What the pulsar lacks in power makes up with mileage in my personal experience while touring i got a mileage of approx 40-45kmpl. 5. Service and maintenance: being made my bajaj the bike does not have high maintenance. I would say this bike is so very reliable. The build quality is such that there are no frequent breakdown with the bike. I don't remember a single time in 28,000 km's and 6 years of riding any one incident where my bike broke down. Apart from consumables i believe the bike has the lowest maintenance cost in class.Now with all the being said I would leave it on you to decide the pros and cons All i can say is the cons of slightly less power can be easily ignore by all the pros of the bike in terms of performance, handling, low maintenance, mileage and sheer looks.",4 years ago,5,5,5,5,5,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,Lets say oil change at 4500 KM's and 7500 -8500kms for general service.

Bike would behave as if like there was no fuel in it and then suddenly it would accelerate. Many times this would result in bike turning off even when riding.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Naked sports street fighter poor mans champion,"1.The buying experience is nice and as it is a hot cake model  everyone is trying to get to this bike as it has almost same power and torque of that duke200 2.Actually i went to the showroom it had only red colour but i want white colour next day only i got my ns200 babe buying procedure will take 2-3hrs like fitting and 3.Coming to the riding point of view its a definitely  a poor mans ktm in the beginning the gears will be slightly harder and when u upshift and downshift sound will come and  initially the bike will heat alot more in the beginning until first servicing and cornering is fine. One rider and pillion is comfortable to ride 4.And the look are amazing man especially the wolf like headlamp everyone is asking for a led head lamp but trust me this halogen head lamp is very good in deed. I never checked about its fuel economy i filled a petrol of 7.23ltrs and it gave me 295kms mileage for that. Everyone is struggling to get how much fuel for one bar1bar =1.5ltrs and it can easily clicks around 110 easily. The clucth leaver is at the edge you will find some discomfort you can adjust it to in 7 days And when u want to drop the gears in traffic sometimes it wont drop i guess its my bike defective will check it with showroom.The riding posture is nice 5.Service cost Oil i mean bajaj oil will cost around 460 like that and for oil filter it takes 79 rs like that 6. Pros :-    its headlamp,its tail indicator,6 speed gearbox, 300mm big front disc, better tyre grips,perimeter frame,comfortable riding posture,abs,naked style which make u unique,its availability of spare parts if anything goes wrong, and its spare parts are very cheap also Cons:- coming to the cons. I must say they would have included 140mm rear tyres, dual abs,navigation system,crash alert,lean angle,slipper clutch, and its build quality could have been more better ,and the indicators should have given a led ones, apart from that everything is fine Problems for it in rainy season. You will get squeak sound if ur machine  runs in rain, and a alot of dirt will accumulate on the engine by the front tyre they should have done something with it to protect the engine from dirt In fittings they wont give me front mud guards dirt protector so i bought it from bajaj showroom and fixed it ,i advice bikers not to buy bikes in rainy seasons as dirt will accumulate on the bikes And the bikes pain is some white delicate. I say if dirt stick to the machine remove it with the water because cloth will leaves marks on the bike. Always maintains ur disc brakes very clean by washing it with the shampoo.

I love the performance of the bike ....Pickup ...But mileage is bad........ And in long run the default seat given are not of comfort ...... Which makes me tired ...

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,An amazing commuter and a perfect starter!!,"It was in 2012 when i booked this beast. It took about only a week for the bike to be delivered to me. The staff was very friendly and caring during the time of buying. I had no issues with that.First when i sat on the bike. The bike was very comfortable to sit and the seat quality was good. It was not that amazing but manageable. The bike is very smooth and the throttle response is perfect for a 200cc bike. It gives a tough competition to a lot of bikes like cbr 250r, yamaha r15 and has a much better response and comfort than it's competitors. The bike is perfect for long rides but gets hotter at a very long distance commuting. Say about 350kms. Fuel tank is less compared to its rivals. I've never experienced any back pain or any other body aches till now. Gear shifting is not smooth but okay. It has a manageable 10 litre fuel tank. Mileage is around 30 kms in the city and 40 on the highway.Looks: the bike has one of the most sexiest looks in its segment. It has a much much better looks than it's rivals. Performance is amazing considering it's a 200cc bike. It has around 21 horsepower and has a performance which is much better than the r15 and other 200cc sport bikes. Top speed is around 140-145 km which is enough for the indian roads. Considering the price tag it's more worth than the duke 200, and has a solid strong architecture and performance on par with the duke 200.Service is not an issue on the bike. The bike needs to be serviced once in 4 months to get the maximum performance of the beast. Maintenance is rock solid and i've been owning this bike for 5 years now.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,Revisiting the pulsar mania,"I have purchased my sweetheart (pulsar 200ns) on my birthday, so eventually, i pampered my inner rider with a 100k design masterpiece of 2012. Since this was the first motorcycle i purchased, so feelings were mixed as the payment modes are also mixed ??. 10K cash, 15k from cc and rest is the loan. Haha, surprisingly i purchased in such a hurry i never checked interest rate and finally, within 4 months i ended up pre-closing the loan and exhausted part of my life savings. Now, the experience was awesome and mind boggling. First ever 3 spark plug system so performance was top notch. I knowingly use to race the likes of 220f or rtr180 to learn its raw power. Obviously never tried the likes of cbr250 and duke200 but the throttle response was accurate and perimeter frame, bybre front rear discs generate confidence. Though i feel i dearly missed slipper clutch, fi and abs which are nowadays part of the new offering from bajaj. Stock tyres are real time downer, i switched to michelin pilot street radial after a year and oh my my this rubber was sticky as hell, leaning on curves was massive improvement. Stock led tail lamp was much ahead of it times but downside was the headlamp, i was disgusting halogen bulb, so i skipped this with bi xenon lamp and it was charm in long highway runs or city areas no/less street lights. Now mileage in real time basics is creep, when you revv hard it turn bad. I used to get 35kmpl on moderate run. Seat comfort is a compromise on long distance and you sure need an iron butt better modify for generous support. A refreshing ride and bajaj kept the pulsar brand alive, thus it lacks refinement in comparison to japanese offering from yamaha or honda.",7 years ago,5,4,5,3,3,Occasional Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,Try the new ns200 test ride before settling your mind as my vote is in for dominar rather.,0,0

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Ns 200- the speed beast,Searching for a bike is a always a task. Bajaj being one of the best leading bike brands has satisfied me with the ns200. 200cc naked beast can rip apart both on good roads as well as off roads. Pillion riding is a an issue but the rider has all the comfort. The beast looks pretty especially during night with those eyes below the headlight. The under belly silencer which just adds the beauty of it. The bike which still rules in the 200cc segment in the market. Servicing the ns200 can be a task as the triple spark plugs are in an around the engine.

But this bike stays on top of list in terms of performance n power delivery.. I had gone up to 148 km/hr with pillion ... I think it can do a bit more at least adding 2km/hr to make it into 150 series....Its worth the money u pay... Definitely duke 200 is much better than mine.. N coming to the mileage ... Mine gives 37+ in cities and 40+ in highways.. It obviously depends on the rider... So overall its a good bike... Pillion seating s not much comfortable in terms of cruising... So finally if there s no pain there is no gain.Overall the bike performs the best good mileage good power awesome look that everybody should look.Definitely one of the best product from bajaj.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,5,Review,It is really an awesome bike. It easily goes on a higher speed such as 120 to 130 with out any vibration to the rider. Handling is as easy as it could be. Both the tyres have a wonderful grip with the road which usually avoids unwanted accident. It gives a superior average of 45kms with just one litre of petrol. And especially the horn of the bike is as loud as it is the horn of a car. This great bike also comes with the award winning feature called self start. It also has a side stand light which helps us to remember the side stand is still down and now we have to pick it up. The disk break in the bike which is located in the front tyre is very dependable and there is a separate section fill with oil just for disk break. This oil helps the break to work in a really smooth condition.Over all it is a very much paisa vasool experience. Full dhamaal in a very cheap price and with an awesome look from far and close view.It has a really powerful piston.,7 years ago,5,5,5,5,5,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,3-6 months,It should be serviced per 5000 km.,0,0

Servicing and maintenance : still a new bike....But will update once i'm done with the first service, as we already know bajaj is not so heavy on your pocket...So no issues with the maintenance.5. Pros : the looks(the best in the segment), 6 speed gear box(lot of fun for weekend rides to cruise @110 kmph.,stable), the power(the best in the segment), affordable price tag(the best in the segment), riding posture, performance,style(new paint scheme is just awesome...) ... And lot more....Cons : every bike has it.... But i have to say there should be fi & abs (at-least as an option).. What Indian bikers have done to you bajaj...U released fi variant in other countries. At least fi variant should have been offered to Indian market... Well abs (personally i don't prefer for the 200cc bikes...Don't require actually, but for higher capacity motorcycles it is necessary. )A damn good bike for the price and highly recommended for beginner to mediocre riders...(hands down)Hope you guys find my review informative and will help you to make a decision to buy this amazing machine ns 200.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,A bike that ticks all the boxes,Buying experience is good at bajaj as always. Good efficient delivery and paperwork done on time.Riding experience is as good as it gets at this price.Breaking(non abs) and power delivery is pretty good.Need to ride the bike smartly for the first 1000kms to make full use of what it offers later on.Any bike requires a good maintenance in order to perform at it's best.Its gonna treat you the same way you are treating it.Servicing at bajaj depends on where are you getting it serviced. Best suggestion would be to get the stock engine oil changed 1500 kms after first service. Use motul or valvoline fully synthetic oils.And the same oil thereafter every 3.5k kms.Top end of this bike is always pretty good and stable.Mid range riding depends from rider to rider.But yes it could be better.Pros1. Great styling and handling2. Good power delivery3. Excellent braking even without abs4.Liquid cooling and 6th gear is a bonusConsNone really. But yes the vibrations around 4-5k rpm is there.But again that could negated with a little smart riding.OverallPlease go for it.

Bajaj Pulsar NS200,4,A Machine that can do Anything What ever you wants.,"My One of Close Pal brought this bike in 2017  . As you know there is  a universal rule ""jo tera hai wo Mera hai"" so I got a chance to ride this Beautiful Machine Many even for Many Months.After riding this Beautiful Machine, Here Is My Opinion About The Non Abs Version of NS200.First of all let's talk about Build quality. To Be honest my self its has Good build quality except the Funky LOGOS that are not good at all. Now coming to the handling section its so nimble, You can easily take U Turns and faces  Heavy traffic without any problem though its weight around 150kg. The next  point is The refinement, Boy Oh Boy  it is a Power full Quick refine Machine, No Vibration at lower RPM even Higher RPM except The Red line only,Otherwise no vibration at all. And You can Easily Ride in Higher Gear in Lower RPM, and its also smoothly  Put The Power Lower RPM to Higher RPM like ""a Knife chopped a butter"", and Gearing  system is so smooth, you never feel any kind of false transformation. Coming to The Breaking Sections, Front Break have very Good initial Bite in short very Good stopping power, You gonna fall in love With the Front Break.But The Rear break is Gentle and have some amount of bite but the Rear break  not properly working after couple of  months and also Front The Break Loosing to. You have change your both  Break pads after 2 or 3 half months probably. Coming to the suspension set up, in Front suspension it is a soft and Rear suspension is little amount of stiff.The Front suspension easily soaked all bumpers like a Giant eating his meal and the rear also done quite good job.It has soft suspension so its Don't have that much stability in High speed, but this bike have decent amount of high speed stability, so you can have some fun.And The Riding posture is not that much of sporty ,its little bit bent down.The most important topic is  heating issue, its quite hard for me to comment on this topic because I don't ride this bike continuously for 4 to 5 hrs, so can't comment on that and most wanted question is the mileage, so I hardly get 23 to 27kmpl in city.Now let's talk about Pillion comfort I think traditional Saree And Chubby Cheeks Gonna struggle little bit and Other Slim cheeks enjoy the Ride with a Huge Gigantic enormous Smile.I short its a Good Bike .just I wish Bajaj Should change the instrument cluster because it is not that much eye Catchy.and Their Service Guys, Because they don't know how to service This type of Machine. They just know how to Service Bajaj's Paltina.It is very difficult to service this Machine Properly in Bajaj's Show room.This is the problem you gonna face .",6 years ago,5,4,5,5,5,Everything,Never Owned,No Data,Never owned,Check your both Break pads and Change your Engine oil whenever need.,0,0

Bajaj Pulsar 125,3,Please read this before you buy !,"I purchased it for 83 k including accessories and 5 years insurance at mumbai. Got its first service done, finished 680 km till now. Its giving around 55-50 mileage at 45 -50 kmph speeds.. I am not satisfied with the mileage because my friend is getting 50 km mileage for his pulsar 150. During first service the service station guy told me that he set it for maximum mileage but i found that its all waste of efforts it dint resulted in increase in mileage more over mileage decreased after first service now i am getting around 45km. I think the carburetor is not delivering the fuel properly or some other reason but my bike pickup is poor. I drove others pulsar 125 and they are also like that only. I also own splendor plus i feel that splendor plus has more initial pick up and power than my pulsar 125, i don't know why my pulsar is taking that much lag to pull my bike. During riding up the bridge i am not able to confidently overtake the vehicles even though the other vehicles are even at 45-50 km speed.We definitely will feel the low power in the bike. Coming to the brakes i think the back brake is the worst for this bike and whenever we apply rear brake we have to push it with more energy and it never gives confidence that it stops vehicle until you apply front brake, coming to front disc its actually works like a drum brake, but happy that its slowing down the vehicle sharply but we will never feel it as a disc brake. Riding comforts and suspensions are good but seat is not broad believe me you will feel the stress in your bottom during seating position (i am 5.6ft height) during long ride.Guys after this all i got a chance to drive my friends honda shine sp, i really felt that i was sitting on a spongy thing  riding was butter smooth with far more better initial pickup and power than pulsar 125 neon.I brought this bike after saving money for around 6 months. I feel that i really wasted my money for my passion towards the pulsar series and its style. Because now, i have no confidence in its engine too after facing all these. I pray god and hope at least the engine should sustain. I am the fan of pulsar, but this 125 neon totally disappointed me.

Bajaj Pulsar 125,1,Worst mileage in this segment.,Riding is worse. Rear shocks are bad. The mileage is very bad. Hardly comes 38 KMPH for normal rides. The kick rod gets hot while driving.

The launch of this bike with the same body work, it is definitely most aggressive daily commuter bike available in the market right now in 125cc segment. On performance front, with 11.64bhp, the bike is fabulous. The extra bucks you give for 125cc compares to other is worth. 75-85 kmph is very easily achievable and that's very cumbersome task for other. Only con that i experienced is it's unsmoothness when you reach 75 or more kmph speed. Service cost is very low...I have 3 services done till now with 9000km done and it cost me 1500 in total (oil price included) the bike is made for the city ride and occasionally speeding.

Bajaj Pulsar 125,4,Muscular 125cc,"Bought it on november 2020.Bs6 model ,black and orange colour.Riding experience is good. No vibrations till 6000rpm. You can easily cruise at 60-65 kmph on highways. On highways it can easily give 50+ kmpl of milage. In the city you can expect the mileage to be somewhere around 50 km per litre. At first the engine heat could be felt at legs. But after a couple of services no problems as such. Considering that it is a 125 cc motorcycle , it looks exactly like the pulsar 150 which i personally think is a good thing .Except the engine almost all the things are just identical to the pulsar 150. No doubt that it is the best looking 125 cc available under 1l.Performance is decent although overtaking big trucks on highways may get a little difficult, but you cannot expect more from a 125cc.Servicing and maintenance of bajaj is very cheap ,moreover as it is a pulsar you can get all the components in each and every city of india.Pros of this bike are: muscular looks ,good handling, relatively wide rear tyre, good performance.Cons of this bike are: relatively heavier than its competitors and hence little difficult for beginners to ride although it is beneficial for highway riders. No digital instrument console or led headlights .(you have to replace your halogen lamp with an aftermarket led one otherwise it is very difficult to ride at night on highways)In the end my conclusion will be if you want to buy a muscular 125 cc motorcycle , want an average milage and if you like pulsar and take your motorcycle frequently to highways then pulsar 125 cc will not disappoint you.",2 years ago,5,4,4,4,5,Occasional Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,18,9

With just a few thousand kilometers logged, it remains in near-mint condition, reflecting the care it has received from its previous owner. This low mileage ensures that the bike's engine is in excellent shape, delivering a performance that feels as fresh as when it first rolled off the assembly line. The engine's responsiveness is one of its standout features; it accelerates smoothly and efficiently, providing a satisfying and powerful ride whether you’re navigating congested urban streets or enjoying a leisurely cruise on the highway.The bike’s handling is equally impressive, thanks to its well-tuned suspension system that effectively absorbs shocks and bumps from the road. This translates into a comfortable ride, even on less-than-perfect surfaces, making it an ideal choice for both city commuting and longer journeys. The Pulsar 125 also boasts precise and predictable handling, which instills confidence in the rider and makes maneuvering through tight corners and heavy traffic a breeze. Fuel efficiency is another area where the Pulsar 125 excels. Its advanced engine design ensures that you get the most out of every drop of fuel, which is a significant advantage for both daily commutes and extended trips. This efficient fuel consumption helps keep running costs low and reduces the frequency of refueling stops, contributing to a more convenient and economical riding experience.The bike’s braking system is robust, featuring a disc brake at the front and a drum brake at the rear. This setup provides reliable stopping power and stability, enhancing overall rider safety. Additionally, the Pulsar 125’s design combines style with practicality. Its sleek, aerodynamic profile not only looks modern and appealing but also contributes to better performance and efficiency. The ergonomically designed seating ensures comfort during long rides, making it a pleasure to ride for extended periods.In summary, the Pulsar 125, with its very low mileage and outstanding performance, offers a remarkable blend of reliability, efficiency, and comfort.

It gives approx. 50 km / litre and about the performance it beats every other bike which is within this range of price. It's looks matches with people's of all age groups. It comes with spacious and comfortable seat. Anything which you buy needs maintenance so that it can live longer. Honda cb shine also needs regular maintenance and servicing.

Bajaj Pulsar 125,4,Lack of straight line stability.,I own the top most variant of pulsar 125 i.E split seat bs6 version. Its class-leading in its segment and engine is smooth n refined. The exhaust note is also soothing. My only problem with this bike is when I left the handlebar while riding my bike immediately tilts towards the right side. It's like the bike doesn't have any straight-line stability. I took a test ride of another pulsar 125 but it has the same problem. The personnel at the service centre stated the reason that it is happening due to the weight of disk brake and callipers which are on the right side of the front wheel.,3 years ago,5,5,5,5,4,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,No Tips,15,12

Bajaj Pulsar 125,4,Pulsar 125,"Pulsar 125 is a commuter segment vehicle, So it\'s not a performance-oriented one.The riding position is good and it\'s also good for taller guys. Overall weight is a little big, But sometimes the weight is good for stability and handling (it\'s only included in the times of cornering and build quality matters).I will get 45 kmpl mileage in the non-traffic straight rode. The top-end speed is 113 kmph but if you cover 70 kmph, the Vibration level is at the peak and at this time the engine wil produce excess heat and it will irritate your legs (especially right leg).Chain portion is a curse of pulsar bikes so it will also disturb you in this bike at every 500 kms (loosed chain and sounds from inner sprocket section). Service cost is slightly high in authorized service centres. After-sales service depends on your dealer; i think popular bajaj is gives you a better service experience. No extra features like gear position indicator, Usb charging port, Bluetooth connectivity, Abs etc.Abs system was replaced by a combi system in to this bike.Pros :-Good performance Good average (50 -55 kmpl)Comfortable Good looking Cons:-Service is costlier at authorised service centre Sound issue Vibrations",19 weeks ago,4,4,4,4,4,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,Change oil after every 3000 to 3500 km.,3,0

With decent riding, you will get about 50-55kmpl on average which is like a blessing. The bike looks absolute gorgeous definitely feels like you're sitting as royal seating.

I had a confusion of what bike to choose because both the bikes came up with an little differences. Then i choose ns 160 for its mileage and low cost than ns200. The buying experience was amazing the bike came to my hands after one week. I used to go to my college by bike the engine is very smooth  i was able to handle the bike very easily though it weighs 142kgs. The nitrox mono suspension is very nice it allows you to travel to a longer distance without back pain. Tough it has an smaller front disc (240mm) its braking is superb. Overall the riding experience is nice. I was really impressed by its looks it has a great look and sharp edge design that everyone in the road will turn and see this bike.  I personally like its pilot lamp that you can find that is ns from a long distance. According to maintenance and servicing i ride my bike below (5000rpm) so that  the maintenance cost is low. I am very disappointing with the gear shifting and it has very small tyres and it doesn't allow enough grip during curves.

Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4,Ns160 review - buy this over the competition you will not be disappointed.,"Bajaj has a very good idea of what youngsters need in their motorbikes. Behold the new 2021 Bajaj pulsar ns160. The pulsar ns range has been capable option since it's inception with the ns200 in 2012. After 5 years, Bajaj launched ns160 in 2017. This made Bajaj pulsar a leader in sports bike segment. The ns range has been upgraded to bs6 for year 2020. New colors were launched like the pearl metallic white and the frame was painted white to make it more sportier. The engine now incorporates fuel injection and has more power and torque than the outgoing bs4 variant. The suspension has been tweaked for better handling and the abs software has been tweaked for better safety. The bike has been a performance benchmark for 150-160 cc segment and the new bike has been same as well. As an owner of 2021 bs6 variant myself, i would recommend  pulsar ns160 over it's competition, which is very impressive because the competition has some seriously performing machines. It is testimony of how much far Bajaj has come in making pulsar a name in budget sports bike segment.",3 years ago,4,5,5,4,4,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,No Tips,8,4

Their is no heating issue in this vechile coming to servicing its has cheaper parts as compared to rivals need to change fork oil every 10000kms carburetor cleaning every 25000kms  as all knows bajaj mainly had a chain slagness issue but by doing proper lubrication it last 25000kms for my vehicle i always use 3m or motul chain lubes or from company oks lube i had done about 38000kms in 2 years which included only long rides such as chennai to trivandrum i did about 15 times and chennai to thirupathi chennai to pondicherry chennai to bangalore trivandrum to malapuram etc etc pros: handling looks night headlight visibility shock aborbers illuminated switches telescopic frame cons: service quality is poor maintenance for chain and bearings clutch life about 30000kms only rusting in saree guard and other parts rear view mirrors lack view I prefer liquimoly 20w50 for my bike And motul chain lube Always use genuine parts other than chain lube and oilIf u love reving to high use liquimoly shooters oils and addictive else use motul 20w50 semi synthetic oil.,4 years ago,No Design Rating,No Reliability Rating,No Comfort Rating,No Service Experience,No Value Rating,Daily Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,6,2

The bike looks stunning as its a copy of its elder sibling ns200, the only difference you'll note is the rear tyre which is thinner,the additional saree guard and the ns160 logo.

Bajaj Pulsar NS160,5,Amazing bike in its segment,"I bought this bike in January after so much confusion between ns and fz vr 2. And after two and a half month i can say that i have taken a right decision.Looks : i was very confused between ns and fz. First i took test ride of fz , that felt pretty good. But when i saw ns 160 , it was amazing , the muscular and sporty looks. Guys if you are planning to buy 150-160 cc bikes so go the bajaj showroom and do checkout ns looks.Riding experience and performance : i am using this bike from  3 months almost for daily commutation and i got no issues yet.Its a beast in its segment , good pick up nice balancing. It can easily go to the 100 kmph mark without any major vibration. I love to do short distance racing with other bikes and ns never let me down. Nice braking system you can easily control when you are riding above 80 kmph. Pros : amazing looks , nice pickup , nice handling , oiled cooled engine so no heating issue, nice breaking system.Lets talk about some cons which i have felt : Cons :When pillion rider is on seat then this bike seems little bit heavy. Also you need to throttle more to speed up bike. Pillion seat is little bit hard.Sometimes kick start doesn't work you need to kick several times.In winter sometime self start doesn't work at once , you need to press 3-4 times, But in summer self start is pretty accurate and smooth.. Just need to touch button.* you can do one thing when in winter self start is not working. First try to kick start ,2-3 kicks. Then press self start button and engine would be start.Final verdict : as bajaj ns 160 tag line 'unleashed the power' this bike definitely contain power. So if you are planning to buy 150-160 cc bikes for daily commutation so do check out ns once and take a test ride. And who already have ns 160 so do proper running in and give some time to engine to settle up and then you will be ready to unleashed the power.",6 years ago,5,5,5,5,5,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,3-6 months,Do proper running in.

I was very much impressed by the handling of the pulsar. Bought it same day and have been riding it everyday .The best thing about pulsar is the heritage of stunts as well as racing that it has, being the first indigenous sports bike in India .The handling is much better than the competitors. Also has a better power band than most of the competitors. Company claims a top speed of 110 kmph as indicated by the speedometer, but can easily go upto 125 km/h as indicated. Has a good mileage for the performance that it has. Been getting a consistent 40-45 km/l in city and about 50-55 on highway.Servicing and after sales support is much better than what tvs provides. I also own a rr310 but i am not happy with the after sales support of tvs, even ordering a spare takes weeks.The ride height as well as reachability is good for short riders. The pedal placement is also comfortable for long journeys. The only main issue is that the under belly exhaust eats up the clearance but overall it is an all round good sports bike.

Bajaj Pulsar NS160,5,The best & best pulsar ns160,"The bajaj pulsar 160 was one of the first motorcycles to really kick off the performance 160cc segment in india. Powerful, muscular and primarily affordable – this was the mantra that worked in favor of the original pulsar and there has really been no looking back ever since. However, this segment of motorcycles has seen an evolution over the past few years and now features European styling, improved dynamics and even a bump in cubic capacity. The pulsar 160, evolved as it might have, never really got on this bandwagon. But bajaj finally has a remedy to that in the form of the new pulsar ns160.Of course, this doesn’t mean that the pulsar 150 will be replaced – far from it! it still contributes to a large number of sales for the company and it will live on in a slightly more ‘commuter’ role, while this new ns160 will be squarely aimed at those customers who want a more premium and sportier motorcycle.It’s got the looksBajaj really did a great job with aesthetics when they rolled out their original ns, the ns200, back in 2012. The bike saw a brand new design language for the pulsar family that took inspiration from internationally successful high-capacity street nakeds such as the honda cbr1000r, and even five years on, it’s still one of the best-looking bikes in its segment. So enthusiasts should really appreciate the fact that bajaj has kept the styling of this new ns160 nearly identical to the 200’s. All the panels, such as the bikini fairing (including the headlight), the chunky fuel tank with its extensions and the sharp tail have been carried over without change. It even retains the same clip-on handlebars, digital instrument cluster with analogue speedometer, split seats, foot peg brackets and foot pegs, along with the minimalist number-plate holder. In fact, at a quick glance, you’d be hard pressed to notice any visual difference between this ns160 and its larger sibling. From the saddle, there’s no way of telling them apart, thanks to the riding position being identical.Take a closer look and the differences can be seen. The front forks are thinner, as is the swingarm and the tyres. And since this has an air-cooled motor, the radiator shrouds are empty for the most part (though if you peep far enough inside, you can see a new oil cooler), the motor is visually smaller, with distinct cooling fins, and there is no rear disc brake either. You’ll also notice a kick-starter on the right side of the engine casing – a feature notably absent on the ns200.With styling from a bike playing in a full segment higher, the ns160 is a good-looking motorcycle no doubt. However, the skinnier forks and tyres lend it somewhat of an odd look from certain angles – the analogy of a body builder with chicken legs comes to mind.Big bike feelAs mentioned earlier, the seating posture is no different from the ns200, with an unchanged rider’s triangle (the distances from seat to handlebars to foot pegs). This makes the ns160 feel like a much bigger bike than anything else in this segment as soon as you hop on to the saddle. While many might rejoice this, the tallish 805mm seat is higher than all its rivals, and though we don’t think this will be a problem for anyone but the shortest of riders, the fact does remain that many buyers in this segment appreciate lower saddle heights. However, its 170mm ground clearance is the highest amongst its rivals and something a lot of riders in India will be grateful for.Engine is the starThe real highlight of this pulsar ns160 is its new engine. Lessons learned when creating the power plants for the discover 150 and later the as150 have given birth to a 160.3cc, air-cooled, twin-spark motor which gets a four-valve head as well as oil cooling. It makes a healthy 15.5hp of peak power at 8,500rpm and 14.6nm of torque coming in 6,500rpm. With the most power and second-most torque in its segment, the performance is really noticeable. We weren’t able to record any performance figures during our short test ride, but the motor just loves to rev and the acceleration is rather brisk. But more impressive than that is the engine’s sheer tractability. Thanks to a long-stroke configuration, there’s plenty of grunt at low and mid ranges which allows you to pootle around town at speeds as low as 18-20kph in third gear without batting an eyelid. And even when you poke it with a stick, the motor feels completely comfortable holding speeds of up to 110kph at around 9,500rpm in fifth gear. Ride it at about 80-85kph in fifth gear, and the motor feels absolutely in its sweet spot.Bajaj decided to stick with a five-speed gearbox for the ns160, but its ratios feel perfectly suited to the motor’s power delivery characteristics, with extremely short first and second gears for easy city ride-ability. Another pleasant surprise with this engine is the refinement level. Sure, it doesn’t match the refinement levels of bikes like the suzuki gixxer or the yamaha fz fi, and there is a typical ‘pulsarness’ to the way it sounds, but it’s smooth for the most part and even the buzz that did come into the bars and foot pegs at about 6,500-7,000rpm doesn’t feel too intrusive.Dynamic dynamicsOur first small test ride of the ns160 happened on rain-soaked roads outside of pune, so there wasn’t much of a chance to really push the handling envelope of the motorcycle. But any concerns about its slim tyres – 80/100-17 in the front and 110/80-17 at the back – were thrown out the window after the first couple of corners. At low to moderate leans at whatever speeds the rain allowed, the ns160 felt absolutely planted and didn’t set one foot wrong. No doubt, the mrf rubber at both ends do a great job, but a lot of this dynamic ability has been achieved thanks to well-tuned suspension and that phenomenal twin-spar frame that’s been lifted straight from the ns200. This frame was originally designed to manage quite a bit more power that the ns160 can throw at it, and the ease at which it handles anything this smaller-capacity motor demands is noteworthy.When you factor in the reduced resistance that the slenderer tyres offer, coupled with the 10kg weight reduction from the ns200 (the ns160 weighs just 142kg), you end up with a bike that’s willing to change direction without much effort. And at the same time, the longest-in-segment 1,363mm wheelbase (identical to the 200) ensures that there is plenty of stability when maneuvering the motorcycle.As mentioned, the suspension is really well set-up, but not just for improved cornering ability like the ns200, which can feel a bit too stiff over sharp bumps. The ns160’s suspension, which comprises of conventional telescopic forks at the front and a gas-charged monoshock at the back, feels firm, but there is no harshness when riding over broken roads. Even bumpy surfaces do very little to upset the bike’s orientation. To be honest, it offers a good blend of ride quality and handling, and while it can’t be defined as plush, the word ‘comfortable’ certainly comes to mind.On the braking front, the ns160 comes equipped with a 240mm petal disc at the front and a 130mm drum at the back. These aren’t the largest brakes in the segment, but there’s plenty of bite and adequate feel when squeezing the lever. Even when riding on wet roads, the brakes offered predictable stopping power and the tyres felt up to the mark in handling retardation forces as well.Sum of all partsBajaj has certainly hit all the right marks when creating the ns160. It looks great for the most part, the motor is highly tractable and the bike handles and rides well too. Our short first ride left us with a very positive impression of the bike. However, let’s not forget that it has to go up against extremely capable motorcycles in the segment which it plays in. Priced at rs 78,368 (ex-showroom, delhi), it does hold a price advantage over the likes of the ya",6 years ago,5,4,5,5,4,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,> 1 yr,Best,1,0

Bajaj Pulsar NS160,5,I like it,"The bajaj pulsar ns160 borrows its styling and bodywork from its elder sibling – the pulsar ns200, and that’s not a bad thing at all. In fact, the ns160’s perimeter frame chassis is also shared with the pulsar ns200. But it gets a different swingarm, different suspension, and different size wheels, and different brakes.  The ns160 gets the same muscular streetfighter look as the ns200, with an aggressive looking front end and sculpted fuel tank with large new-age decals on the tank extensions shouting out ‘160’.How does it perform?The pulsar ns160 gets an all-new 160 cc engine. It’s all-new yes, but not entirely brand new, so to say. Bajaj engineers looked into their own existing portfolio, taking experience and learnings from the earlier four-valve twin-spark motors like that of the discover 150 and as 150, and applied it to this engine. Yes, it’s got new cylinders, new pistons, and a new balancer shaft, so if you’re thinking it’s nothing more than a bored-out pulsar 150 engine, then that is not correct",6 years ago,4,3,4,5,4,Everything,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,< 3 months,110,1,0

Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4,If you want style with speed buy pulsar ns 160,"Bajaj auto took its time to introduce a premium 160 cc motorcycle to play in a segment which has seen increasing sales over the past few years.  In fact, the premium 150-160 cc segment now claims more than one-third of the total sales of motorcycles up to 400 cc, so it became even more imperative to have a product in this sub-segment. So, it’s a case of better late than never for the bajaj pulsar ns160, even though the ns160 has been in existence for a while now, but only for bajaj’s export markets. The pulsar brand has been bajaj auto’s claim to fame, so to say. Even today, you can still see a lot many pulsars on the streets – the pulsar 135, pulsar 150, pulsar 180, pulsar 220, pulsar rs200 and the re-launched pulsar ns200. But it’s the humble bajaj pulsar 150 which commands its position as the largest-selling 150 cc motorcycle. But there was something missing – something, which re-defined the bajaj brand, like the way the first pulsars took the Indian motorcycling scene by storm nearly two decades ago.The suspension is slightly on the softer side, so the pulsar ns160 isn’t as stiffly sprung as, say the ns200, but that means it offers a more comfortable, pleasure ride and that is a bonus for the daily commute, and in-city duties. In traffic and within the city, the bike steers with precision and will certainly satisfy a lot of riders going over undulations, broken roads and the like.",6 years ago,4,4,4,4,5,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,3-6 months,Changing oil after 5 months is important as well as monthly maintenance,1,0

Bajaj Pulsar NS160,4,Class Topper,"First I would like to thank bajaj to bring the monstrous look of NS200 to its sibling NS160. It is the king in its class I am explaining why...I got him:) 3 months and 12 days ago from today. 2nd day after buying I understood this bike is surely an eye catcher. Let's do it easy...Pros: 1. Riding quality...the aggressive riding position with that perimeter frame will give you the sports bike like feeling. 2. Increased torque (14.60 Nm) do its job very nicely. If u have ridden a pulsar 150 before you can feel the extra torque quite easily. 3. Soft suspensions do a great job on these potholes filled Indian roads. 4. Underbelly muffler gives it a duke like look.5. Now time for technology...twin spark ignition, 4 valve intake and outlet system and oil cooling system will give u the confidence in long riding and low emission. 6. Although the headlamp is not LED its super bright in dark night. Now let's see the reason why I didn't give it the 5 star.Cons: 1. In highway or in high speed and rpm the gear shifting is very smooth but in low speed u can experience some issue on shifting which u can get over after some regular rides. 2. The pillion seat cushion is super hard...in bad roads it is worse. 3. It lacks a rear disk brake though it has bolt thread to set it up.4. It lacks a gear position indicator and a engine heating warning.5. It would be better to get the rear tyre little wider... Now time for comparison, I know its getting longer but it will be a full review thank you for your patient. The only bike now a days can be compared with it is...yes you guessed right CB Hornet 160R. You may think why not Gixxer but trust me its way below level and older bike for these two new Hulk. It can't match their performance. Now Hornet also is little backward than NS though it has a wider rear tyre, rear disk and 0.16Nm extra torque. 1.With the shield like headlamp, clip and wide handle bar, split sits and analogue/digital console NS do the checkmate in styling. 2.With almost 0.25bhp more power, twin spark digital ignition system and oil cooling system NS standing 1st in performance and technology. That's why I called it a class topper. Anyway guys time to sign off. Thanks again, take care.....",6 years ago,5,4,4,4,4,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,3-6 months,Clear the chain on regular basis as its a slag catcher.

I drive the bike and there is no difference but difference is in starting, pickup which is poor. Handling wise the tank  vibrates that's little weird. NS 200 is best one out there for street race & long trips. That has liquid cooled engine. But this one has air cooled. Worst braking system please update ABS brakes. Tyres is small but it's ok. I don't check top speed it's ok I drive at 90 km speed and it good. Fuel injection is good one. Suspension is too good. The head light gives best appearance on the road.

It's a bike for daily commute but you will definitely feel the lack of power and disc brakes at the rear. The drum brakes does its job but it doesn't stop instantly and the tire skids a lot3. Looks are as similar to the elder 160 and 200 but in terms of power it's way behind. The gear pull sucks. You can't even ride at a speed of 20kmph in the 1st gear.  The acceleration is very slow and top speed i reached was 113kmph. But definitely has lack of power and gear ranges are very low. And the tyres are very thin and u won't feel the confidence.4.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,Detailed review of pulsar RS 200,"Hello,  I am Samarth Pawar I come from Karnataka a small city called Mudhol. I bought a Bajaj pulsar RS 200 Bs6 red color in the year 2022. So I want to share about my buying experience- when I decided to buy a new bike but my budget was only under  2.2Iacs  I took many test rides of various bikes but, I didn't feel the power and torque of any bike other than pulsar RS 200. There is no company that provides 24bhp and 18nm torque and a fully faired bike in just 1.7lacs ex-showroom. So I finally booked the bike in another city because there are very less Bajaj showrooms where there are knowledgeable dealers and mechanics for Bajaj sport bikes because in small cities and towns, there are very less sports bike users and mechanics available. So, I bought it from Vijaypur City the delivery experience was good and the dealers also have a good customer relationship. So, now about riding experience I have taken it more on highways and less in cities it gives me better performance and fuel efficiency on highways but there is too little fuel efficiency in city rides it is comfortable for riding on highways it doesn't get any backpains while riding a full faired bike. It runs too smoothly on highways and has smooth gear shifts it doesn't vibrate till it achieves 100kmph speed. Overall I had a good riding experience with it except for the rear tire the company provides 130-section rear tires for the bike it does not have a good grip at high speeds and on cornerings because it is not a radial tire and the tire size is too short for this bulky machine. When it comes to the looks and performance I have already said that the bike has very killer looks and a bulky muscular fairing it looks awesome from all sides but what I like the most is bs6 2021 edition colors these variant colors look dashing. And the performance of the bike is it provides 24bhp and 18nm torque and it can achieve easily 140-150kmph speed at a maximum in 40to50 seconds when we ride it below   5000 to 6000 rpm it runs decent but when we twist the throttle above 6500rpm it runs very aggressively. But it feels like missing of slipper clutch in it for high-speed downshifts. Know, about service and maintenance- there is a bit higher maintenance for sports bikes as compared to regular commuting bikes because these bikes are performance-oriented bikes that need regular service and maintenance but bajaj service is a bit cheaper compared to other companies. However, there are very less authorized service stations and mechanics for Bajaj sport bikes another disadvantage is Bajaj uses low-quality engine oil for ns200 and rs200 for cost-cutting bajaj has to upgrade its quality of engine oil. And lastly are the pros and cons.Advantages-* it has good looks and design. * has good power and torque. * has a refined and smooth engine.* Pocket-friendly to maintain.* it comes with liquid-cooled technology and a six-speed gear box.Disadvantages-* there are very less knowledgeable mechanics for sports bikes.* I  wish it could have a slipper clutch and a wider rear tire.* they have to improve the fit and finish quality of products.* they have to reduce cost-cutting and upgrade the quality of products.* there is very little availability of spares in the service center.",46 weeks ago,5,4,4,4,4,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,> 1 yr,Carry good quality of engine oil while servicing.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,4,Pulsar rs 200 for grocery to drag race -d,"I took my pulsar rs 200 abs - yellow bs3 out of the showroom on 17th aug'15. It was my first bike in my life on which i learnt how to ride a bike (avoiding the indian tendency to learn driving on splendor, etc)So, from this everyone will conclude that if a person is with his first and only one bike then he will not be able to figure out the cons due to lack of experience with other bikes It's not like that my friend, i will be honest to tell everything i experience and depending on your choice you can categories these points into pros & cons.So let's get started!Jumping from honda active to pulsar rs 200 will be overwhelming and really enjoyable, because of its power which can be felt as soon as the throttle is pulled. At first, i felt like the bike is dragging and i would fly like a dry cloth :-dBut eventually i learnt to handle it quickly.As per the name and bike's attitude to be sporty it was meant for high speeds but since i was a higher secondary student at the time of purchase i was unable to ride it much. Just after 2 years, i started my college where i started earning part time to fuel my bike to the fullest.Slowly, i started to take the bike for mid-range weekend rides for about 100 kms and pulsar rs 200 being the only vehicle in my home became the grocery to nail shop taker. It means that i bought 10kgs of wheat keeping it on my tank and it was really easy to carry the grocery due to the tanks wife design and flat base.From this you can know the situation in which bike is used. Crawling in jams for grocery with pulsar rs causes a lot of pain in the wrist and engine starts to take big sips of fuel and along side the overheating issue.I barely got chance to full throttle the bike at 6th gear by living in between the busiest streets. So, one day i felt to take my bike on highway (agra-expressway) closest to my reach. I went full throttle on this highway till the toll both which appears after 30kms of stretch. My words can't explain the adrenaline experience of it's 153km/h pull with amazing torque and sound.This was my first experience which gave me the understanding that what pulsar rs 200 can do with it's full potential. I started visiting the expressway on every Sunday with my friends, where we used to do many races. Not to brag about i used to beat every 200 cc easily and this bike made me proud. At some point i competed against cbr 250 r, it was the only bike which has defeated the my pulsar rs 200 and it was a fair lose. Though, still rs 200 can cope up with cbr 250 r till 150 km/h.And taking the bike on rides where you have good road is a bliss with mileage, power, exhaust sound, and posture. Exclude, the butt pain caused by the hard plank like seats. The tyres cannot hold on to the icy roads easily otherwise off-roading is fine.Now today (27th jan'22), overall my bikes engine doing great with more than 35,000kms and with a mileage of 33.46 km/l in worst case scenario.But! the most irritating and worst part of this bike is the front right side vibration and the low quality wind shield (visor) which breaks after a few months of usage (now, changed to db visor). The visor issue is fixed but after 6 years ownership i couldn't fix the vibration of front right side (tried all measure).Though the vibrations comes up rarely but when it starts i feel to go to a walk with my bike for the rest of the road. It's really bad for the wrist also.Engine is commendable with the performance and mileage after 6 years also.Maintenance is very cheap though i use Germany exported engine oil b-)Sharing my own experience on pros & consPros-:MileagePower,Adrenaline feelExhaust soundLow rangeTop endTourerDragsterCheaperCarrierReliabilityLooksHalogen projectorsDrlsCons-:Front right vibration (not curable)I shared my life experience of owning the pulsar rs 200 from tip to toe.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,Unbelievable beast,"First of all I am writing this review as Pulsar Rs200 was my dream bike and now I own it for almost a month with around 1100 kms done.To start with it this bike is a absolute beautiful piece of machinery be it the looks the power the pickup the comfort, stability braking, it is just awesome bike. The raw power that you feel with smooth beautiful riding experience is just heavens, especially on Highways with the top gear in its place the bike feels magical. With this bike you have the power that you want, the comfort you need the stability and the braking are all very good and best in class. My buying experience was very easy I bought it from Raj bajaj turbhe, the staff is helpful and the whole process was very smooth where I got my number in 1 week and my rc in 2.If you want a bike in 200cc segment full faired and till 1.5 lakh range believe me this is what you want where if you want abs its is 1.66 lakh and let me tell you please if you can go with abs please buy it with abs because it works and has saved me couple of times. Now as always these were the pros and now the cons which I have only three1. This is the biggest con of the bike where if you ride the bike with a pillion the bike's belly will touch the speed breakers.. this is 100 percent true and a sure thing which will happen.2. This happens sometimes, where when you are down shifting from 2 to 1 gear, it sometimes gets stuck between the two gears.3. Now this is related to area vise and is about the servicing of the bike, If you stay in Navi Mumbai Raj Bajaj are the only authorised dealer and service centre for Bajaj bike's, as they say although my buying experience with them was very easy with such a good bike but the servicing was pathetic, it was very bad and not at all worth what you pay. I think they take it for granted and just do a show when it comes to servicing.These are the cons of the bike but compared to the whole package it is nothing to cry about.

Quality wise the rear mono shock absorbers are not that much builded. They are to be replaced as oil leak problem is common.The chain also gets loosen fastly so many times u got a visit to the servicing centre.Pros: ~sporty design~fuel efficiency in 200cc segment~premium high seating riding quality Cons:~poor pickup~fairing vibrations~downshifts are hard.,6 years ago,5,4,4,4,4,Leisure Rides,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,change oil after 3000 kms or every 5 months.,39,9

The highlight is that it has hidden features.1-if it reaches max speed for 10 seconds it automatically offs the engine.2-if the stand is unfolded the bike never starts.3-it has charging plug near the right handle bar.But usage of this would requires a software.4-suppose if the bike falls down while riding,the bike automatically offs the engine.There are other two more features,that are not described by the showroom or bike module book.Well this bike is provided with abs technology which proves the safety while racing.Almost from my experience the overall review of the bike was gorgeous.In service and maintenance it was very good and trusty.Riding experience as a youngster is amazing with your girlfriend.Try to check the other basic features in bikewale website which is original.Try to buy a bike with abs technology.",6 years ago,5,5,4,4,5,Everything,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,No Tips,23,4

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,4,Rs200 my black eagle,"Buying experience:First of all i have inquired about the bike at jai bajaj-chennai., obviously extremely worst experience., then i went to my home town(salem) and have done the same, but response was quite fine, and service response was much more better than chennai. They have add some addition charges and all the bajaj showroom doing the same and saying this is for handling and bla bla charges. Over all bajaj showroom and service center response is not good.Riding experience:The bike comes with perimeter frame (semi)  and box type swing arm which give more stability , cornering  and quick braking confidence . Since already i have better experience with delta box (r15)and diamond frame (cbr250) this stands in-between., obviously much better riding experience than cbr250r especially high speed and quick changing directions.. Carrying speed at high way is the most which i love in this bike. Details about looks, performance etc:Front look is amazing, looks like eagle eyes. Incomparable night vision. Rear side exactly opposite especially tail light which i hate the most because which makes the bike looks like small 100cc bike when you sight from back.This bike comes with triple spark plug with high thermal efficiency at high rpm which gives adequate power at top end .  Front braking is more effective  and responsive thanks to bybre , 300mm disk and abs.Rear brake is fine but not the best like r15.Fuel efficiency is good. For long trip it returns  26-30kmpl (usually i have maintain 120- 140 kmphr at high ways) capable to cover 350km without worries which is not possible with cbr250r at high speed.Transmission is soft  and not quick as compared to rc or r15 but not bad.Servicing and maintenance:Service interval is around 5000km. Which is value for money.Engine oil, oil filter , air filter , coolant cost just around 1500rs. Pros and cons:Pros:Head light,Seat height,Top end performance,Low maintenance,Touring,Value for money.Cons:Build quality,Missing sporty riding and aerodynamics,Rear seat and tail design,Complex build(not easy for quick service like yamaha but better than cbr).Long term reliability : (please wait for 12 more months or 70k + odo)My experience:Ownership : 12 monthsOdo : 35000+Max speed: 156kmphBest long trips: Nine states nasty ride (dec-jan 2017)Chennai- salem-bangalore-hyd-nagpur-jhansi-agra-jaipur-udaipur-guj-mumbai-pune-hubli-bangalore-salem (5800km in 8 days)Sun temple ride:Chennai-vizak-araku vally- orisha- konark sun temple - puri- chennai (3000+km 4 days)Thanks ,Poonkathirvelan(the life of rider)For ref:Poonkathirvelan Current bikes:Yamaha r15 (2012-till) 115000 kmBajaj rs 200 (2016- till) 36000 km Previous bikes:Cbr 250r abs (2014) 20000kmYamaha fazer (2013- 2016) 80000kmApache rtr 180 (2010- 2012) 60000 kmRe 1970 model (2011-2013) 15000km",7 years ago,4,4,4,4,3,Tours,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,0.5 rs  km average exp 35000 include tyres,18,0
Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,4,"RS200 - The good, the bad, The Ugly","I purchased this bike back in 2015 when it launched with high expectations because of the Bajaj brand and I have to say after almost 8 years, the bike has exceeded my expectations.Yes, there are its faults but which bike doesn't have them? The looks are what attracted me, a sports bike with 200cc and good power along with great design and ABS was a perfect combination for me The riding posture is great, performance wise it's able to easily catch up with R15 and other similar-priced bikes. The lights are great and the sound is just wow. You will get an amazing experience riding it The service has been great by Bajaj but a bit towards the higher price side I might say considering it's a 200cc bike and maintenance is okay. If you keep doing the regular service on time, the bike will be great for a lot of years. The brakes are great and having ABS on the front has been a blessing in disguise in many situations. Now that I've spoken of the good about the bike, let's move on to the cons :The number one con I would say is the pillion seat which is very uncomfortable and slippery. The pillion tends to slip forward towards the rider every time the brakes are pressed and sitting for a longer duration in the pillion seat causes backache Number two would be the cost of service as mentioned above Number three would be its handle, the turning degree or angle is very limited and it's hard to take U-turns. The rider has to take long turns or else the bike tilts Other than these I haven't felt any major cons.The mileage is great and has a huge tank as well.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,4,Review of pulsar rs 200 with practical and true feelings,When i buy pulsar rs200 the feeling of getting sports bike only guys know that feeling not to describe in words.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,4,Pulsar rs200 most detailed information and review,"I was planning to buy a motorcycle which would be a second hand 2017 duke 390 which i was getting in a price which is equivalent to the new pulsar rs200, i was looking for a bike which can do a good digits of top speed and have good acceleration and the main thing was to do highway riding between 100-110 km/h with absolutely ease with stressing the engine at all. Also i was looking for a motorcycle which is practically for commuter with good performance to overtake and also would be pocket friendly and reliable for longtime storage as well for like 3 to 4 months. I heard that the ktm 390's are the inexpensive to maintain amongst it's category compared with ninja 300 and other 300 to 400cc motorcycles. So i took a test drive if the motorcycle both the rc390 and the duke 390. Honestly i was very much impressed with the performance of both the motorcycles. Then i came home and researched a lot about ownership maintenance and issues, that was the point where i felt heartbroken. I saw many problems with the tft display and ride by wire throttle including few other electronic and the moist problem with the tail light, engine heating in traffic, poor fuel consumption in the city and all which got me into a negative impact also the tyres and sprockets and other parts was a bit expensive for me so i dropped the plan of buying the ktm. Also i had a conversation with my friends of friends who owns 390's. So i thought about the dominnar 400 which is a value for money product but it's the same the price of 2nd hand 2019 models were a bit higher than the ktm 390's and the older model of the dominnar i didn't like it also the price wasn't less. One fine day i was in the traffic and saw an rs200 by my side so thought about researching about the pulsar rs200 so i started. One day i went to the showroom and took a test ride and its was a very good motorcycle indeed not as blisteringly quick as the ktm 390's but it has very good performance and pickup. So it impressed me though i wanted to own a bit bigger bike but that was not comfortable for me with the maintenance and other things so i immediately decided to book the rs200. Also i had seen some people complaining about the vibrations in the fairing but honestly i didn't feel any though it was a bs4 model. The sitting posture of the bike is not aggressive or committed but its a very good for daily committing also touring purpose also the pillion seat is adequately comfortable. So i went back home and had planned to buy it on monday as i took the test ride on saturday evening. So i kept my research continued also i was seeing some of the used bikes to see the resale values. Meanwhile i saw a sparkling brand new rs200 which had done only 4.7k kms in the odo and it was only 7 months old in extremely well maintained condition and he quoted the price of 95k as he was leaving the state. I immediately called him and went to see the bike next morning at the first glance it impressed me a lot and it was smooth and refined without any scratches or spots in the body. I immediately settled the deal for 90k and it became mine. The puslar rs200 is a very good bike in terms of reliability and maintain is inexpensive though the bike is a bit on the heavier side but its alright. I had a great performance and had a great ability to cruise at 110-115 km/h with ease without stressing the engine at all. I serviced the bike at 7.5k km and almost changed everything for superior performance and smoothness the thing's i changed and done was:- Engine oil 10w 40 full synthetic Engine oil flush Changed engine oil filter Changed fuel filter Changed air filer Changed the spark plugs Changed the brake pads Changed the coolant Changed the battery (just for satisfaction)Changed the tyres (due to multiple punctures)Changed the chain set (for own satisfaction).Cleaned the injectors Cleaned the fuel pump Cleaned the throttle body (thought it was not required but still for smoothes) Changed headlights to led (low power consumption and good visibility.These were the following things i changed few things were not at all required to replace but still done because i wanted to over pamper my bike and keep it extremely fit and fine. Now talking about the fuel consumption and fuel maintenance to avoid fuel pump malfunctioning:-I use to get without servicing was 30 kmp/l (tested) which was least i got in an horrible bumper to bumper congested traffic and where i wasn't able to even shift to 3rd gear and on the normal daily traffic and city usages it delivered 33 kmpl and on the highways it delivers 38 kmp/l. With normal unleaded petrol and with power petrol it gives 35 in city and 40 kmpl in the highways. The fuel tank is of 13liters and delivers a very good range as per the performance. Any fi motorcycle needs to keep the fuel pump submerged with the fuel so it can avoid malfunctioning so it requires 3 liters of fuel for safety. When the fuel bars starts blinking it indicates you to fill your tank immediately coz its the time it starts to uses your 3 liter safety reserved fuel. Well digital fuels meters can never show accurate fuel level but you must not run the bike with 1 fuel bar. Atleast keep 3-4 bars. The best thing would be to once fill up the tank and until it reaches to 3 bars you can use it then after again fill the tank and always try to use power petrol for better performance and to keep engine smooth and healthy.Servicing and maintenance :-The normal and basic servicing is changing the engine oil at every 7000 kms if using full synthetic oil else do it in every 5500 kms. The servicing includes oil change, oil filter change, airfilter change and coolant flush and motorcycle washing. Which costs around 1500-2000 including labour charges (depending your city) without major parts changing and price may differ by the quality of engine oil and coolant you choose.Change the chain sprocket in every 17k kms if you ride with proper chain cleaning and lubrication at every 500 kms then max it can go upto 19k kms. Change the tyres in every 13,000 kms depending what tyres you use soft compound or hard compounds be it anything its always better to change it when you see it starts to loose its grip and starts becoming plain. Change the brake pads when you notice lack of bite never use it until the pads completely worns out because that might damage the disc rotors so change it maintaining the safe side.Performance:-The pulsar rs200 is the fastest bikes of all 200cc bikes in india. Acceleration of the motorcycle is very good and quick the 200cc motor has enough power to to reach top speed of 145 kmh with pillion and without pillion the speedometer shows 152 kmh which is more than enough for Indian roads. But the speedometer has some errors in it whereas it actually does 139 kmh with pillion and 145 kmh without pillion as per the gps actual top speed.  As this is a high revving engine it requires to push the throttle more to climb uphill the torque is also sufficient to push the motorcycle anywhere thought it requires a bit high rev but does the job very easily. The sweet spot of the bike is 6,000 rpm where the engine feels very smooth. Pros:-Abs Looks All india available service network Seating position Performance Fuel consumption Low maintenance Led indicators Cons:-Needs removing fairing just to change the air filter Seat height Weight Conclusion :- For me buying this bike is worth because unlikely the ktm 390's it doesn't heat up to roast your legs, fuel consumption is also great parts are affordable and durable. Its looks sporty and can commute daily and also practical i would not recommend to spend twice the amount of money on big bikes with 400cc just to get extra 20kmh top speed and crazy acceleration. The pulsar rs200 is definitely a value for money and have a great performance for its segment. If you have budget and maintenance and fuel consumption is not an issue then go for 400cc.",4 years ago,5,4,5,4,5,Daily Commute,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,"Keep atleast 3 bars of fuel, service it timely, for better life of chain sprocket clean and lube it at every 500 kms and clean the throttle body and injection at every 30,000 kms to prevent lack of power, engine stalling also to have good fuel consumption and power.",10,2

However, few drawbacks - stiff riding;(really hurts on long rides), exhaust sound(could be more masculine), rear view mirror position, only single channel abs (now it comes with dual channel) and vibration at higher rpms (though at those speeds you may not pay attention to that as you'll be occupied with the handling).Rest everything exceeds your expectations in this price segment.",3 years ago,4,4,4,4,5,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,"Allow the bike to run in.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,A classy budgetary sports bike,I got it from a local dealer and drove about a 7500 kms till now. The riding experience is superb and would suggest to go only for the abs version of the bike. The abs brakes just works simply awesome. Not that comfortable for huge sized body people. Even same for the pillion though the seats are really comfortable if you are average weighted guy. Have touched a top speed of 125 without any problem. The only problem is the bike sometimes get heated up in traffic due to less ventilation openings. But doesn't happens when you are riding long without traffic. The another problem is that the bike gets rusted quickly if exposed to lot of water and not cleaned properly. Even need to polish it regularly since the fibre parts (even black) turns pale if exposed to lot of water and sunlight.  Service and maintenance cost is less. I have an amc in my bike with sai service which does a pathetic job in servicing. But no other option for servicing. I get it a teflon coat in every servicing. This whole thing has never costed me more than rs. 1800 (major service). The average is pretty decent of 35kmpl. Overall i love my ride. It was and is my dream ride!,7 years ago,5,4,5,3,3,Occasional Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,"I would suggest use nitrogen in your tyre.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,My dream bike,"I bought this bike in the evening of 10 June. And from that day i rode it 384 kms, there is nothing which is lacking in performance or in any other things. The bike is very excellent in performance, i took it to 149 kmph and it catches the speed very easily. There is no sign of vibration above 135 kmph , thanks to its pressed perimeter frame to handle the engine at high revs. The bike is awesome at high speed and very very very much stable at corners and road due to its weight. Which is very good for race lovers. This gives the mileage of around 34-35 kmpl. Which increased to 38-40kmpl after first service. So no concerns for so much refilling of tank. And in the last the looks of the bike is awesome from the purchase date more than 100 people asked me about the bike. The overall performance of the bike is awesome. Even 220 is unmatched in performance with bike. So the other bikes likes karizma zmr, r15, apache, cbr150r have to stand in the footpath, when it comes on the road.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,The go-to bike in the entry level faired bike segment,"if you are looking for an affordable value for money ""faired"" bike, RS200 is the answer to it. I am emphasizing on faired because if you want a naked bike, which is again affordable, you gotta go for dominar. either way getting back to RS200, the only close rival is the R15 and here i will state the reasons to consider rs200 over r151. It has perimeter frame2. Optional ABS, which is single channeled. but it is better than having nothing.3. it is 24bhp and has ample power. lower down as well in the rev band it is pretty smooth to filter throigh the traffic and out on the open road is where it shines. the tacho meter goes all the way upto 11k rpm and the bike actually comes alive after the mid range and screams at the top end of the rev band. the acceleration is very linear4. the riding posture is not agressive hence you can tour and ride longer than the r155.the pillion seat is comfortable (atleast when compared to r15)6. service costs are hell cheaper than yamaha. so oocket friendly even after sales.7. it is on the heavier side weighing at 165 kgs, so that helps to keep the bike planted on open roads and easy to handle in city traffic as once it starts moving you ain't going to feel the weigt.8. projector headlamps provide ample visibility at night, yes the r15 has got all led headlamps but i have compared and rs200 shines here in this department as wellLast but not the least it is an indian product. it isnt necessary to go for it. but it is a small token of appreciation and support to an indian brand. so. that is whole review. the comparison contains the review as well.",5 years ago,5,4,4,4,5,Everything,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,Keep your chain cleaned every 500kms and adjust the chain slack in regular when ever required.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,4,Owners opinion,Look wise and power wise this bike is quite good. It comes in a reasonable price and competes hard with rest bike of same features. But some major disadvantages prevent one from suggesting it to others. Like its mantainnance cost is too high. This bike often needs maintenance at short spans which cost big to a middle class man. It is  also a bit heavier than rest of the bike in market. Also it ground clearance space is low. But performance wise this is quite good. It voice of acceleration is terrific. It sometimes gives a feeling of bullet bike. It can attain high speed at very less time. It's has both disc breaks as well as drum breaks. Disc breaks allows quick pause to bike. This bike is made for new generation. Truly a beast of its kind. More important it comes from a very well renowned company Bajaj. Which has a number of service centers overall India. Almost in all cities. It can easily be maintenance.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,Bajaj pulsar rs200,"Before i start off with my impression of the bajaj pulsar rs200 after the brief ride i had on it at bajaj's test track in chakan, i must accept that i suffer from a little paranoia and reluctance when it comes to the pulsar name. I've had a love-hate relationship with the bajaj pulsar. I've ridden all the pulsars to come out till now, and have had some really good moments with them. I also suffered a very severe accident a decade-and-a-half ago while riding the original pulsar 180 that almost cost me my life. That's stuck with me ever since.Anyway, before i hit the track on the rs200, i was given a crisp download of the product. The bike has undergone some major, and some not-so-major revisions compared to the pulsar 200ns - the product which the rs200 is chiefly based on. However, all that chatter needs to translate into actual performance advantage - with the rs200, it does.The engine construction broadly remains the same, but the rs200 gets a new head and, more importantly, fuel injection, as against carbureted fuel supply in the 200ns. Power rating has gone up by one horsepower, and the rs200 flaunts 24bhp that peaks out at 9,750rpm. The throttle response is definitely crisper and more instant on this bike, and that's sort of needed as well - to offset the bulk of about 15-20 kilograms that's gained in form of the fully faired plastic body work and other technical components like the abs unit, etc. I've not been a great fan of the 200ns - its seating was a bit weird and i wasn't ever comfortable with the handlebar-seat-pegs geometry. The rs200 gets a shortened rake - so the handlebars are closer to the rider and the entire seating position is biased more towards comfort; it's more upright than outright sporty. For a bike that's positioned as a sports product, that kind of works - which is very strange! i guess the design was never meant to offer aggressive riding posture to begin with. The seat itself has good padding - that's a great thing.I was riding around bajaj's official test track, and around the corners the rs200 felt a bit less entertaining than what i thought it would be - especially because the suggestions from its engine were very encouraging. That leaves you with mixed feelings. Though the chassis balance is quite good, the default suspension setup is rather soft and my heart stopped for a second on one hairy moment i had while leaning into a fast right-hander. I'm sure the ride is going to be quite worthy on regular city roads going at regular city speeds, but if you'd like to enjoy some track riding or want to go knee-kissing around some snaky ghat roads, i'd say you tune the monoshock a bit in favour of handling.Engine note - again, at lower revs, it doesn't sound all that great, but at full chat the rs sounds genuinely good. And speaking of full chat, at one point, i saw 148-149km/h on the speedo - keeping a margin of error in mind, that would translate to a realistic speed of just over 140km/h. That's plenty fast, but the vibrations still tend to creep in to bodily areas that i shall refrain from mentioning. The initial gears are susceptible to vibrations so i was just short of short-shifting through the first two cogs, but from 3rd gear on, i was revving the engine to about the 9,000 mark and there was a pronounced buzzy sensation through the seat. Also, if you're riding without gloves - yes that happens a lot in real-world scenario - you might even feel a slight bit of vibration through the handlebar grips. The gearing is essentially the same as in the ns, but the sprocketing has been altered to help the rs achieve a higher top-speed.With that being said, what i really liked is how neatly and quickly the rs200 turns into corners. The steering is very responsive, and the slightly modified construction and compound of the mrfs that the rs was riding on makes a world of difference. The lean angles that the bike can manage would've been really difficult with the default suspension setting had it not been for the confidence that the tyres offer - both front and rear. The brakes now - the rs200 is offered in two trims: abs, and non-abs. I was on the saddle of the abs version the whole time, so please pardon me for being unable to tell you any functional attributes of the non-abs variant. The abs offered is a single-channel system - that means only the front wheel gets abs equipped braking.While you don't quite feel the abs working in regular riding situations, it's more prominent in emergency or panic episodes. Under hard braking, the front did keep its line and the brake bite was sufficiently effective. I'd have liked more feedback from the lever though. But it's the rear where things get a bit eerie. While going full angry on the anchors, the rear end tends slide - that's not what i expected one bit! it was really unnerving the first few times, but then it became fun and i did that a few times just for the heck of it - that's definitely not recommended.The rs200 is, as can be clearly experienced, more aggressive than the 200ns - so, expect the fuel efficiency to be lower than its non-faired sibling: mid 30s (35km/l) or thereabouts i guess.The rs200 is placed in a segment where it fights against the likes of yamaha r15, honda cbr 150r, and the ktm rc200. It does manage to look slightly bigger than all of these, but, crucially, it also looks the most controversial. There's a sense of overdone everything about the rs200. The front is dominated by a very peculiar looking body work that flows down the centre and looks like an extreme snout, and the dual-projector head-lamps remind you of the latest yamaha r1 - and i don't like those either!The tail-lamps, too, are just a bit too weird, and the rear section from the front seat on, leading up to the lights reminds me a bit of the karizma and the original xtreme by hero. Strange, i know. The rs200 looks a bit over-the-top, a bit too try-hard, a bit silly, a bit brash, and a bit fussy. It gives a sense that bajaj designers were deliberately thinking hard to make the rs200 stand out. It may have worked in a way though - the rs does catch the eye easily, but not in the most pleasing ways.The rs200 is not as entertaining as the r15 or the rc200 - those bikes are in proper full-attack mode from the word go, whereas with the rs, you need to spend more and more time on it to get familiar with its boundaries and character. Its limits are not as great as its rivals from ktm and yamaha, but at being a flaunt machine, the rs200 might just be good enough for some unusual college-goers.Thank you",4 years ago,5,5,5,5,5,Everything,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,< 3 months,No Tips,5,2

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,4,My review based on for the last 5 yrs of usage. Loved it!!!,"I bought this beast on 2018, and while the time of sale, it was fantastic to purchase this bike, as it can be used for daily rides in the city and for a long drive too.   Never thought about taking this bike, I was expecting to take NS, however, when I test drives both, I felt NS is a little bit low when compared to the torque in RS. I really loved it when I took the test drive and chose this beast.Really for the past 5 years, I felt like I am going to handle a superbike, but on this low budget, I think this was the best bike that has an equal amount of weight to support the ride with a pillion. Its pick-up speed was fascinating even with the pillion. Performance at this beast is up to the ultra level. Loved its performance for the last 5yrs. Looks are impressive like an angry bird. With dual projector came up with halogen, unfortunately, I switched it with 6k led lights which provided me a vast vision on the night rides. ProsIt has impressive torque in this segment.Dual projectorABSMileage of 32 to 39 for me-Depends upon the rideRefined engineCan be used for daily commutes.Parts are reliable and service costs are nominal.Cons1. Bike is so heavy. If u got a battery problem in mid of the roads it's difficult to get this started or towed.2. Bajaj must improve their service, they will collect the money with GST but no proper mechanic has been installed to analyze the minor and major problems of the bike.3. After 3yrs u will feel the issues from this bike, and the engine will be making noise unless it's been rectified. 4. Under this budget I can understand Bajaj has provided fairings in cheap plastic, which makes lot of vibration after 3yrs. It will make u irritating when u ride with that vibration noise from fairings. Need to rectify it all the time with the tools provided and believe me THERE IS NO SOLUTION for this.Final advise. This is good for youngsters or persons aged between 20-40. I personally loved this bike. The only major drawback is the service center and its mechanic. Otherwise, this was one of the best bikes to do drags under this 200cc segment. Go for the test drive and make ur decision before buying this bike.",1 year ago,4,3,5,3,4,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,"Do find a better mechanic than the Bajaj service centres and do the periodicals services.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,A friend's suggestion (for u),Performance:-i loved this bike a lot and i forced my parents to buy me one and lastly i bought my yellow buddy rs200 abs on 3/8/2016 .This bikes looks gorgeous as well as it's performance and it touches 0-100mark in just 10 seconds.. And it got 150+ as it's top. No bike will touch that top in its 200cc segment. Con's:- but this bike has got some con's too (no bikes are except this) ya..! My buddy vibrates a bit but that's not a problem for me .And u will notice some panel gaps (this one hurts :(...) But they do not cause any problems on vibs. These are the con's i have.Comfort:- the comfort is awesome as well as other pulsars. But the pillion seat is small and the pain kicks after 100 kms. Looks:- come on..! This bike born with looks and you will find the result when u riding everyone will look you.(Bike)mileage:- this bike gives a decent mileage too.. I am getting 37 on city and 40 on highways (with the mix of both hard as well as smooth riding) pros:- 1.This bike got abs (single channel) this saved my life twice .2. Look3.Maintenance cost is low i done my 2 services and they've done below 1k .4.Performance5. Sound of this bike when you are revving hard is awesome.Gearbox:- the gear box was hard before my first service after that its become too smooth like butter smooth.And lastly :- friends if u r planning to buy this bike then go for it buddy..! Don't wait . For what others (haters) tell u. U will definitely find that the money u spent on is a true value for money.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,4,Pulsar rs200. A perfect all-round bike.,"Since the time i set my budget of about rs. 1 lakh, i had my eyes on the pulsar ns200. I loved the looks of that bike and 200cc engine ensured enough power for city commutes and occasional weekend rides. But my heart  broke when i was told that bajaj had discontinued the ns200 and replaced it with the as200. I personally was never a fan of the looks of as200. Hence i decided to stretch my budget to rs. 1.5 lakhs. Looking around at this segment in 2016, i just had two options with me, it was either the bajaj pulsar rs200 or the ktm duke 200. Personally, i wasn't much of a fan of the looks of rs200 as well, but then when i was denied the option to test ride the ktm duke 200 by the staff at the showroom i test rode a friend's bike. I almost was clear that i was going with the duke 200. But for once, i had to test ride the rs200 and have a final verdict among the two bikes. I went to the bajaj showroom to test ride the pulsar rs200 and almost immediately was attracted towards the demon black color (mind you, the was the first time i was seeing the bike in person). The test ride was short and sweet and wasn't able to get a true idea of the power of that bike as it was supposed to be a customer bike and didn't want to spoil someone else's bike. I went home and researched about the pros and cons of this bike and as per the customer reviews, the cons outweighed the pros. It was at this moment i was reading about the vibration issues and poor build quality and all the possible cons one can imagine. But i knew from the test ride that this was the bike i had to go for as i had started  developing an unexplained connection with this bike. I made up my mind that was ready to take the leap of faith and deal with any problems if at all they come with this bike. I paid up for the bike, my loan was cleared and i was eagerly waiting for the date the staff in the showroom had told me. They guaranteed the bike to be delivered in 14 days. I wanted the bike on my mother's birthday hence i had kept a week's buffer as i know things can go wrong and was expecting a delay of about 3 days. On the day the showroom staff had guaranteed to deliver the bike i walked into the showroom with all my gears and to my surprise i was told that my payments aren't cleared yet. The ground below me almost fell apart as i had received a confirmation that the loan has been approved withing 5 days of making the payment and applying for the loan. I showed them the mail regarding the same and they had no clue about it, this was the worst feeling ever as i knew under no circumstance was i gonna be getting my bike on my mother's birthday which was the case. Eventually i picked up my bike later on and cranked it for the first time giving it a cold start and boy-oh-boy was i in love with the exhaust note. Performed all the rituals and got it home and almost the whole time i was staring at the bike from my window. The break-in period was a tough time as this bike demands to be revved and the sweet exhaust note is an aural delight. And all the issues that i read of wasn't luckily present in my bike. Post my break-in period i was able to truly unleash the potential of the bike and it has never disappointed me. The handling, the power delivery, the flick ability despite it's curb weight of 186 kgs is just amazing, the brakes also perform well and the abs are a boon as well, the suspension is on a stiffer side but can handle anything thrown at it, the engine is peppy and very rev happy. When it comes down to servicing, it is very affordable to maintain this bike and the parts aren't too expensive to replace. An average service would cost between rs. 1000-1500.  However, the last time i gave my bike for servicing it ""miraculously"" developed deep scratches which despite buffing and polishing is very evident and the head of the service center isn't ready to accept their fault despite the service adviser saying that the bike came in with zero scratch. Coming to the pros, i'd say it is one of the best bike as it is a perfect blend for daily commute as well as weekend and long rides as it can hold on to triple digit speed for hours. It has a very comfortable riding position. Coming to the cons, there are occasional vibrations around the front fairing, but this happens once in a blue moon so that can be dealt with, moreover bajaj have addressed the vibration issue in their 2017 model so you can be rest assured of it. Another con would be that the rider's seat isn't meant for long distances, after 200 kms, one develops butt sores, even this can be rectified by using gel seats or adding extra cushion. The pillion seat however happens to be very uncomfortable as complained by my pillions  and experienced once myself. However, if you overlook all of it, it is worth every money spent on this beautiful machine and i never even for once regret my decision of going with this bike.",6 years ago,4,5,5,4,3,Everything,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,Perform the service as prescribed by the manufacturer and you would never have to worry about the reliability of the bike.,3,0

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,The pulsar rs 200,"Pulsar rs 200 (bs-3) is eye-catchy and is packed up with a great power at a very economical cost. Mileage of the bike is even better than the bikes in its segments like rc 200, duke 200 etc. The bike is also cheap as compared to the bikes of this segment. The maintenance cost is also lower than ktm and original bajaj parts are cheaper and are easily available. However, the bike does not get a dual channel abs which is disappointing. However, for city commute, it is not that much of a problem. Handling is good in crowded areas and does not feel that much bulky. However the weight of the bike is 168 kg's. The major difference of choosing rs 200 is its sitting posture and the uplifted handle bars which gives comfort to the rider unlike ktm rc 200. I am from kolkata and i have been riding this bike for more than a year now and i am very happy with the mileage it is providing (around 33kmpl).",6 years ago,4,5,4,4,4,Daily Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,3,0
Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,Must read before you buy...Personal experience,"Rides: awesome bike for long rides. the sitting posture is comfortable enough.  seat is bit hard for long rides .You can place some seat cushions available.Mileage: i get a mileage of around 50 kmpl on long rides in highways and around 35-40 kmpl on city ride. Though mileage depends on the riding style.Service cost: the service cost is pocket friendly.  the bajaj engine oil will cost you around rs.500-600 along with the oil filter. If you opt for motul the cost will be around rs.1300-1400.  do not use grease and all for chain lubrication rather go for a motul chain cleaner and lube (approx rs.1000).This lubes would be sufficient for almost 10000kms  use a good brand coolant(coolant will be required after a long duration but have it for               top up purposes).Maintenance:  all depends on the riding style and the rider.Rash driving would surely decrease the mileage and will  have impact on the engine life.Every 500 kms get the chain cleaned and lubed.Get the bike cleaned after a long ride.Change the engine oil and filter on time.And better to get the servicing done at the authorised bajaj service centres only.Brand service: the sales person were very much friendly.While purchasing the bike it had a scratch on the visor.As  promised by the sales person they changed the body part the very next day. Looks/performance:              look wise the bike is very much sporty and aggressive.The twin projector head lamp give it a demon look.The new colours racing red and racing blue are very much eye catching. performance wise the bike gives a good acceleration. Though it gets a bit heated near the engine area.The heating is obvious in a traffic area with the clutch applied frequently. bike reaches more than 100 kmph with ease. the abs works good and braking is up to the mark.Though single channel abs,but it saved me twice on highway rides.Exhaust sound is good.Pros : mileage -speed -riding posture -acceleration  -looks Cons :  -vibration in the fiber parts -turning radius.",6 years ago,5,5,4,4,5,Occasional Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,No Tips,3,0

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,4,Best in class at the price,I ride red coloured (abs) rs200 purchased this bike after 4-5 months of its launch. There was just 2 days of waiting time during those days.Riding and handling:At this segment rs200 is one of the best handling motorcycle. I use it for daily commute to office and occasional touring.Looks and performance:Looks absolutely brilliant but at the same time its little overdone in graphics and edges. Could have been little simple while designing fairing. With fuel injection motorcycle has instant response for the throttle. I have reached maximum of 151km/hr of indicative speed. Slight vibrations can be observed after 9000rpm.Mileage:During daily commute in cities i get around 30kml for moderate riding style. On highway for cruising speed of 90-100 i get 40kml. As speed increase mileage decreases and experienced around 26kml for 130-140km/hr speed. Service and maintenance:Service costs are on moderate side. Parts are easily available.Pros:1. Better performance at this segment2. Comfortable riding position for rider3. Abs is added advantageCons:1. Uncomfortable for pillion riders and no grab rails.2. Fit and finish not up to the standards as uneven lines can be seen on fairing fit.3. After market accessories are not widely available.4. Fairing noise.,6 years ago,4,4,4,3,3,Daily Commute,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,Try semi-synthetic oil for better less engine noise.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,Beast of the 250 n below segment bikes,"I bought my bajaj pulsar rs 200 on 4th October, 2016,. And had a great thirst for it, it was available in affordable price of approx 1,50,000. So i bought it knowing that this beast is the only roarer and a true racer in 200- 250cc segment. when i first rode the bike it was an amazing experience, with the most comfortable sitting and riding postures. It might not give you a sporty feel, but is very comfortable in comparison to any other sports bike. The handle bars are up compared to others which keeps your back straight if you are approx 5 feet 7 inches tall. Shifting gears are little bit hard but it doesn't matters so much while riding. The abs part of this bike has a very good performance in an emergency. The roaring sound on a blank track gives you a feeling that is not explainable. The torque is low, so you have to get the gear very low while crossing bumpers. There is a smooth pickup not as much as the yamahas but is very smooth at higher gears or higher speeds. Talking about night visibility, you get a pair of projector headlamps, which are very powerful, i think in this segment.   the look of this bike from front is like a two eyed bird. The back brake light is an amazing attractor to this motorcycle, which gives a shape of love. The pillion seat is not up not down, and 5-6 cm  upper than the riders seat. Engine is covered with visors. And i think you can keep two bottles in the visors below the handle bars on both sides, as i used to.  The sound from the visors are more. the servicing of this bike will cost you around 2000 rs/--  which is quite affordable.It requires quick servicing as i experienced. Advised to service within 5000kms , it requires service in 3000kms.Some of the fittings gets loose after 3000kms which are to be serviced.                  the speed of this bike is higher than that of duke 250, fz250, and others but the pick up is very low. You can challenge all these upto 250 segments in a long highway run, but not in the city roads . This bikes has a top speed in the 250 and below segment.  It has a very powerful racing sound that gets a fearing feel.    the negative part are the sound-full visors, low torques mileage is good upto 30 kms/ litre, but fluctuates on riding. Quick servicing intervals but it has more pros compared to the negative parts. If you will ask for a bike in this segment and within a price range of 150000 rs/- , i will suggest you a brand new bajaj pulsar rs 200                                     thank you",6 years ago,5,3,5,4,4,Everything,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,Change the engine oils in 4000 kms.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,Dream bike to pocket,"Bajaj pulsar..The name itself a brand from its origin. After a lot of research i found the rs 200 as the most affordable bike in the segment of 200cc with abs and lot more features.  It completely justifies is name ""racing sport"". Once you hit 6000 rpm, you can feel its racing throttle. The exhaust really sounds like super-bikes.New colours are like add on features of this bike.Cons: only the thing i miss in this bike is dual channel abs and a large capacity tank. Assuming it as a tourer bike as well.. It should have been provided with 15-18 litres of tank.Also regarding the headlights, i hope if bajaj would have provided with led lamps like dominar. All these would have banged the other bikes in this segment. Maintenance of the bike doesn't mean a lot to our pocket. It's completely friendly. We can hardly complain against bajaj service centre availability in India. It's doesn't cost more than 1000 for its maintenance in the intervals of 3-4 months.We always prefer to have a bike which not only satisfy our daily needs of commuting. It should also serve as a touring bike. With 38 kmpl of mileage on highways, rs 200 meant a lot.If anyone would like to go i would really suggest you.Yes i haven't bought the bike yet and i'm really looking forward to get it within a month.

The servicing is good and maintenance is not as expensive as other bikes like ktm and cbr.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,Rs the speed machine,"Hi, Its been a very good riding experience I've getting since i bought my rs 200 in the year 2016. Its ride is very comfortable even on long drive. And also it gives you a sports bike driving experience as it has a power of speed going upto 150+ km/hr. My racing beast is of yellow colour . In this colour it looks like an imported sports bike. Sometimes people confused to find out whether it is an indian make or an imported make. All these attentions will make me feel proud as i am the owner of one of the best bike in india.                   now when we look at its service status its parts are very expensive but durable and made of high quality material. Un my opinion you should serviced your bike at scheduled period which you can easily find it on you display meter when it is required. Bike should be serviced at authorized bajaj service centre. At least first 3-5 services so you will get its warranty period advantages for 2 years from the date of purchase.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,Legends are reborn,It was very nice experience as it was my 1st sports bike so i was excited.I have completed 15000kms of successful journey.Sometimes it felt that to buy a ktm duke 200 due to its low weight but when it comes to the riding it beats ktm duke.As bajaj have provided sporty projector lights at the front it looks great and u can ride it freely in night rides.The drl's also add great effect it looks great.Coming to the performance it lags in pickup due to its heavy weight but it runs smoothly when u cruises above 60.Feels vibrations after 5000rpm and fairing gives lots sounding and vibrations too.Abs works great and it helps me lot in case of harsh riding in cities.Sometimes you felt that downshifts are bit hardened.As company have provided manual so it is mandatory to service the bike but if u'r running is slow then every 5 months it is getting serviced. Quality wise the rear mono shock absorbers are not that much builded. They are to be replaced as oil leak problem is common.The chain also gets loosen fastly so many times u got a visit to the servicing centre.Pros: ~sporty design~fuel efficiency in 200cc segment~premium high seating riding quality cons:~poor pickup~fairing vibrations~downshifts are hard.,6 years ago,4,5,5,5,4,Everything,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,3-6 months,No Tips,2,0

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,The bumblebee - pulsar rs 200,"Views are all personal. Riders ride style also affects the bike review. Be kind . Namaste. I bought the bike on 30th December 2016. Call it irrationality or my intention to save those 1500 bucks over the upcoming model or rather my eagerness to have a sports bike of sort. I had sold my pulsar 150 a week ago back then, and was adamant on buying either a ktm( rc 200) honda (cbr 250) or a yamaha (r15 ). Going to bajaj again was not a consideration. For i wanted a pure bred sports-bike with the racing genes.I went for  the rc  200 . I was smitten by the beauty. At 22 years of age and being a fitness trainer, i never minded the track built design of the rc. Had a test ride, came a few days later with all documents for finance and that was it...Bam!!! i was  told that due to some finance processing issues i would have to wait for at least 3 weeks before the process begins. It was shattering. That was later figured out to be a blunder but then the correction would still take the stated time. Infuriated, i ended up at local bajaj's dealership as to enquire regarding my previous loan issue that has caused the halt. There, i was introduced to the pulsar rs 200 - bumblebee. My first reaction was wow. Its a big bike. But then, i knew it was a bajaj and would be nothing compared to the ktm. (i knew about the bajaj- ktm thingy though) The executive over there enquired if i had ridden the pulsar  rs before. It was followed by a test ride. Boy, that was a shock.. To the amateur that i was, it was a beauty. Twist the throttle beyond 6k rpm and 6 the gear...It touched 120 before i could have a look on the speedo. Vibrations were there ( surprise) but similar to the ktm rc i had ridden . Then the beautiful tacho was a beauty. Plus the seats. And the darling projectors.All this changed my mind.. I would wend up saving 40000 and get a big bike feel and it was indeed a good decision. 2 years later and 13000 km  after. I don't regret a single day. I drive it at 120+ on sunday rides and regularly commute. Did i miss the stock exhaust note!!!! its  magic. This is the best bike at the price. Yes its not as solid as a yamaha r15 or as smooth as cbr or as agile as the ktm. Yet its faster than the yamaha, practical than the ktm and shinier than a honda. Yet it manages to turn eye. 24 horses from bajaj. Love it, hate it. You can't ignore the package. ?? P.S. I am in dilemma over those tail lights too.!( vibrations are prevalent at speeds 40-60-70 not at higher speeds. Its more refined than ktm rc 200 then model. I don't know if ktm is more refined or has reduced vibrations now. Breaking could be better to properly unleash its power. At 5'9"" this to me is fully comfortable lest u compare it with a cruiser or a naked.Visual appeal is highly accentuated by the yellow colour shade.",5 years ago,4,5,4,4,4,Everything,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,"Have a chain spray, coolant and regular timely services.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,4,Almost the best 200cc bike,"The bajaj pulsar has never failed to impress me and by that i mean all pulsar models. But when i came across rs that's where i found my calling.... I'm more of a sport bike enthusiast so i looked at this bike and decided to go to a bajaj showroom immediately..... My first reaction was to the faring if the bike which i have to say impressed me.... Seating composure is adjustable according to your scenario. You will never find a bike as comfortable as the rs to go around indian roads, that i can assure you. But i said that it's almost the best because when i take my bike for a spin i look mainly for speed only, so that's where a con comes in. The bs4 variant is 10 kmph slower as compared to the bs3 variant. But i like the fact that it's more eco friendly which is quite obvious. For people who seek speed on touring or rides this bike has 151kmph max to offer you (as for the bs4 variant). So i wouldn't argue but you'd expect more from a 200cc bike. That's why it drops a star in my opinion. But let's be honest 150 in indian roads is an accomplishment. So this bike will do you amazing otherwise. The braking is simply superb (with my experience on dual channel abs). It will be a saviour in various situations. So i'd say go for the bike because it's simply the best economy wise and race-wise as well. Even though i have mentioned speeds such as 151 i request all of you to have a proper gear and be safe while riding at high speeds. Please be careful especially on busy roads.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,Powerful a beast. Perfect sports bike.,"A 200cc race sport .The bike is very excellent in performance, i took it to 152 kmph and it catches the speed very easily. There is no sign of vibration above 135 kmph , thanks to its pressed perimeter frame to handle the engine at high revs. The bike is awesome at high speed and very very very much stable at corners and road due to its weight. Which is very good for race lovers. This gives the mileage of around 34-35 kmpl. Which increased to 38-40kmpl after first service. So no concerns for so much refilling of tank. And in the last the looks of the bike is awesome from the purchase date more than 100 people asked me about the bike. The overall performance of the bike is awesome. Even 220 is unmatched in performance with bike. So the other bikes likes karizma zmr, r15, apache, cbr150r have to stand in the corner , when it comes on the road. If you are planning to buy it , i personally suggest you buy today and feel the soul of bike.Budget perfect as the bike gives you a great feel of the sport bike.Power is equivalent to the displacement.As the services is concerned bajaj is the best company which takes the good care of their customers so that will be never a question to you.",7 years ago,5,5,5,4,5,Everything,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,1,0

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,4,Review,Firstly buying the bike was a bit of a hassle because of the customer care executive who was handling me was a newbie. Later things were solved and the vehicle was delivered to me after 15 days of booking(earlier it was promised that the bike would be delivered within 4 days). When i first drove the bike back home i was just astonished by the power the bike delivered and also almost crashed into a car because of my speeding. I use the bike everyday and it gives me a mileage of around 22~25kmpl by rash driving in the city. The power delivery is very linear and also the sound really gives shrills and makes the driver go faster. I've driven this vehicle for around 6000km(i do a lot of long drives... Like every weekend) just in a span of under 6 months and have observed that the only con in the bike is that all the parts become loose after sometime and also start vibrating and make some irritating sounds. Except this the brakes the engine everything is worth every single penny you pay for the bike. If you want a sports tourer and you have budget constraints.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,The first bike in the bajaj stable that turns heads everywhere,"Bajaj may not have the best buying experience, but it is overshadowed by the value of buying a bajaj bike.The rs200 shares its power-train with the ktm rc200 and hence provides 95% of the performance at around 85% of the cost, which is phenomenal. It misses out on a few ktm quirks like the fully digital console.The rs200 looks are subjective. I love the curves and edges, so i chose the racing blue which shows them off.But if you aren't a great fan, you can go for graphite black which gives it a clean subdued look.In terms of performance, it is very dynamic. It can be ridden in the city, on the highway or at the race track and it feels like it belongs. The seating position isn't as committed as other fully faired bikes in the 200cc category. The relaxed riding position makes it a good daily commuter.Bajaj service is known for its widespread availability, but the rs200 falls short since the fuel injection system requires special equipment to service which all bajaj service centres don't have.The only disadvantage is the lack of practicality in daily usage. The raised pillion seat, lack of a foot support on the saree guard and lack of bag hooks makes it slightly inferior to the reigning fastest Indian (pulsar 220f). Overtime it develops a few vibrations on the footpegs and fairing, but that is common to most bikes in the pulsar range. Easy die fixes are available for them.Overall, it's a bike for those who want the thrills of a sport bike on the highway and the practicality of a commuter in the city.",6 years ago,4,5,5,4,3,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,No Tips,0,0

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200,5,my review after 1000km,1. Telling about my buying experience it feel like I am buying any commuter bike which is cheap the showroom guy didn't treat it well actually they are not trained to do such job bajaj has to improve this and they didn't tell me about the bike.2 . My riding experience is so far good as it is my first bike and I love to ride it3 . look of the bike is very good actually some people actually think that design is little bit over done but I like it.4.servicing is not at all problem as the parts are easily available5. Pros:1.nice power but manageable2.styling is good3.i like its headlamp in the night which spread across the road in high beam4.handling is sharp5 braking is nice as it's come with single channel absCONS: AREA OF IMPROVEMENT1 . Instrument console lacks gear indicator2. Dual channel abs will be better 3. Fearing quality should have been better4. Low end torque is lacking as you have to pull it harder across 4k rpm when the torque come slowly slowly the torque builds5.dual horn should be there6.in this price point many companies are giving slipper clutch I think this bike deserves it.,5 years ago,5,4,4,3,3,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,No Tips,0,0

Bajaj Chetak,1,Disappointing Experience with Chetak Electric: Impractical and Overpriced,"I recently purchased two Chetak Electric scooters for my parents, hoping to embrace the future of electric mobility. However, my experience with these scooters has been far from satisfactory, prompting me to share my concerns.Firstly, the Chetak Electric falls short in terms of practicality. Despite its sleek design, the scooter's features are minimal when compared to its competitors in the market. The price tag attached to it seems unjustifiable considering the lack of advanced features that have become standard in other electric scooters.The most significant drawback is the impracticality that arises when the auxiliary battery controlling the scooter's electronics malfunctions. This issue has plagued both scooters I purchased, rendering them practically useless. When the auxiliary battery dies, not only does the scooter refuse to turn on, but it also presents additional problems. The steering gets locked, and the boot refuses to open, creating a frustrating and inconvenient situation for users.What compounds the problem is the abysmal after-sales service provided by the Chetak Electric service centre. Despite facing this issue twice within just six months of purchasing the vehicles, the service centre has failed to offer any definitive solution. The lack of responsiveness and a clear resolution plan is disheartening for customers who expect reliable support, especially when dealing with a product that relies heavily on electronic components.In conclusion, the Chetak Electric scooter has proven to be a regrettable investment for me. Its impractical design, minimal features, and the recurring issue with the auxiliary battery make it a poor choice in the electric scooter market. Potential buyers should think twice before considering Chetak Electric, given its shortcomings and the unreliable after-sales service that fails to address critical issues.",37 weeks ago,1,1,3,1,1,Daily Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,All service are paid.

This EV provides way less range compared to what the company claims it to be, I usually get around 65-70 km range (at 60 kmph highway speed, no more than that). I had a hard time starting this up, unless the Bluetooth key is right in the face of the vehicle it doesn't start. I wished for the limited speed it offers, I could've gotten 80 plus range but it's far from it. Looks are pretty good, and the ride is more or less comfortable but overall, it's an easy pass from me to the buyers looking for a new ev scooter, Ola S1 pro is far better than this and you get what you pay for.",27 weeks ago,4,3,4,2,2,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,3-6 months,No Tips,5,3

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,4,Once the fastest Indian,"Here I am only going to share my personal opinion of this bike:-On 14th February 2018 the day when I got the bike, a nineteen-year-old highly enthusiastic landed in front of the showroom with my mom and bought the bike, the bike that everybody once dreamt of, the bike that set the record of being the fastest Indian, the bike that police knew ' lo ek aur aa gaya 500 toh mil hi jayega'. By now you have understood which bike I meant, yes it's the almighty pulsar 220f. 220 cc with almost 20bhp I felt that I knew the road, as it was an upgrade from the maestro. Initially, I enjoyed it the most except for the mileage as I only got around 35kmpl in the city and around 40kmpl on the highway but later it started accumulating problems like front suspension noise, battery issues, as well as my rear wheel, got locked due to master cylinder failure and all of this took place within two months, wait, what? yes.   Then after sorting out all these problems I thought now I am on the right track then suddenly I had a minor accident with my bike luckily I didn't get hurt but the front fairing got cracked. I took it to the authorized service center they told me sorry sir we cannot get this (volcano red) color fairing as it's not available and we won't be able to match the color thus you should change it to black then it will give a look red-black which look better. I said ok no problem I could wait but I won't change the color than said to me that the company had stopped manufacturing that color that too in only 2 months. These were the issues that I had faced with this bike if you ask me mechanically and all other issues were over time wear and tear. But I would say visiting the authorized service center will make you test your patience as Bajaj's service center is literally one of the worst as the worst title goes to hero. After these issues, I did not have any problems to date. Thus, in the end, I can say if you looking to buy Pulsar 220 in 2023 then please check other bikes as there are much better options available but if are a die-hard fan of 220 then what we can say? Welcome to the party brother!Pulsar 220f is not just a bike it's an emotion there can be many problems yes it's the same 10-year-old design but one thing I can say is ride the bike fully geared up in front of the school children they shout and say wow racing bike...",1 year ago,4,5,4,2,4,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,38,15

While it might not boast the latest technology or design, it continues to hold its ground with a compelling blend of performance, affordability, and a loyal following.PerformanceEquipped with a 220cc engine, the Pulsar 220F delivers a punchy performance. It's quick off the line and offers respectable acceleration. The engine's character is typically Bajaj - eager and responsive, making it an exhilarating ride for enthusiasts. However, refinement levels are average compared to more modern offerings.HandlingThe 220F handles confidently in most conditions. It's stable at high speeds and offers decent feedback. While it's not a corner-carving machine like dedicated sport bikes, it's competent enough for spirited riding.ComfortThe riding position is upright and comfortable for long distances. The seat is adequately padded, but pillion comfort could be improved. Suspension is on the firmer side, which is ideal for enthusiastic riding but might be harsh on poor road conditions.Features and DesignThe Pulsar 220F's design, while dated by today's standards, still has a muscular appeal. The instrument cluster is functional but lacks modern features. The bike misses out on essential safety features like ABS, which is a significant drawback in the current market.Fuel EfficiencyFuel efficiency is a typical aspect of performance-oriented motorcycles. The 220F delivers decent mileage in city conditions, but expect figures to drop on highways.VerdictThe Bajaj Pulsar 220F is a motorcycle with a strong fan base. Its performance-oriented character, coupled with its affordable price tag, makes it an attractive proposition for young riders. However, its lack of modern features and safety equipment is a significant drawback. If performance is your primary concern and you're willing to compromise on technology and safety, the 220F can still be a thrilling ride.

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,5,A 9 years comprehensive user review.,"I am the proud owner of the Pulsar 220F BS3 2014 model.  I have done about 60000 km in this machine and man what a wonderful machine this is. True to its legacy.Here is my experience of owning it for about 9 years.1. I have test-ridden all the bikes from 150-250 cc available during 2014.  Zeroed down to the 220.2. Riding experience was so good that it never made me feel to upgrade to date. Obviously, I will have to upgrade considering the bike's age and the market.3. In the looks department I wouldn't hesitate a bit to say that it aged really well. It still sells as of today.  The market speaks for itself.4. Servicing and maintenance is the least to bother experience. The maintenance schedule as per the manufacturers' recommendation is more than enough.  Even if you miss the periodic maintenance here and there, no problem the machine is built to last. I never faced any major breakdown till now remember it does not come with a kick start.Pros:1. I have taken my bike for rides too 2000 km was the longest I have done. Many short rides too. It is a gem of a bike that you can daily commute and take for rides with friends.2. Low maintenance and good service network. It's a bajaj.3.  Excellent design that ages pretty well.4.  It is the longest-selling bike in its category with no major changes. So no need to worry about the spare parts.5. The existing 5-speed gearing ratio is excellent for city rides. You can pick up even in 4th & 5th gear from a standstill. Cons:1. Sometimes feels like a need for 6th gear in high speed.2. The front fairing is a pain to disassemble. A more user-friendly bolting system would have been good.3. A 25bhp instead of 20bhp power would have been more viable in this machine.",46 weeks ago,5,4,4,4,5,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,This bike can survive in bare minimum maintenance and Bajaj Engine oil.

Bajaj Pulsar 220 F,5,LEGEND FOR A REASON,"The buying experience wasn't that great as in India most Indian bike dealers are just in a hurry to sell the bike rather than making an occasion of celebration for the buyer.I had multiple rides on my bike specially the LADAKH TRIP last year, boy o boy the bike didn't hesitate even for a second on the whole ride which included all high altitude passes like Zojila, khardung la, Umling La & the special one Tang Lang La. One thing that made this ride even smoother was the engine oil which I switched from the regular Bajaj engine oil Motul 7100 10w50.No doubt it's a sexy-looking machine and was a dream for me when I was in School, just a few modifications like a bubble visor, and adv engine guard are the cherry on the top. Comfortable cruising speed is around 90kmph and one thing to note I haven't faced a single breakdown on any ride to date not even a puncture on the ride.Being an Indian brand service cost is always a reason for a smile the regular service is not going to cost you more than 1500 rupees which even includes your brake pads and other small parts.The bike is definitely an amazing machine with a comfortable seating posture for long rides and enough power for quick overtakes in city rides and highways. can't expect more than this from a 220 CC bike of this budget but still the vibration in foot pegs around 90+ kmph speed is a little concerning which was sorted to some extent after I switched the engine oil and definitely this bike misses out on the sixth gear on highway rides.",35 weeks ago,5,5,4,4,5,Tours,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,FULL SYTHETIC ENGINE OIL AND REGULAR MAITENENCE WILL KEEP THIS BIKES HEART ( engine) YOUNG FOR YEARS.,12,4

But things changed later. At 1100 kms, the cam shaft damaged and it took 23 days to get it repaired. 900 kms later, at 2000 kms, engine oil leaked as they had not installed the clutch side cover properly. The front portion of the body is extremely buzzy at certain rpms, killing all the mood for riding, and it's embarrassing too. Without a pillion, the rear seat buzzes too. Since 4000 kms odo, the meter is constantly displaying low oil pressure warning. Not to be forgotten, it's just 5000 kms, and 4 months yet. I visit the service center more than any other place.

The looks are average and not so great. The bike doesn’t look like a big bike but probably is because of the performance. Service maintenance is quite manageable. The mileage you are gonna get in the city is very low around 23 kmpl. But on the other side is quite good on the highway you get around 33 kmpl. If you want this bike for good touring it’s the perfect bike for you. The bike feels heavier and a little difficult to ride in traffic conditions because of the weight.

Mainly used it for touring and the seldom weekend breakfast rides. Only one word comes to mind while reviewing the dominar - all rounder. Daily commute to office, weekend rides or even touring to ladakh and spiti as i found out was all within the grasp of a bike prices sub 2 lakhs. Fuel average ranges from between 25-30 depending on how hard you ride. Only qualm while offroading is the missing switchable abs which is required when you are traversing non asphalt surfaces. Ktm duke 390 would get the upper hand in this department. As it features the oh so desirable super moto mode and a futuristic tft screen that can put any superbike to shame.

Bajaj Dominar 400,4,Best daily commute | review after 21kms,"I've owned the bike for more than 10 months, crossed 21k kms. Dirt, tarmac, notorious Indian potholes, you name it...This will tackle it all, with the exception that the shock travel is relatively less. I never had to change any of the cables - throttle, clutch. Upon inspection, the cable wires appear to be intact, not showing any signs of failing any time soon. Ironically, the chain and sprockets seem to be in good shape too...Thanks to the linear power delivery, and also to proper lubing (btw i don't use motul or any fancy brands...Just the usual gear oil...Just make sure that all the links are properly lubed up... It's not because i'm a miser.... Found out that the usual gear oil is much smoother with the only downfall being getting dirty much quicker).. Back to the subject... The bike is a pleasure to drive, and of-course there are vibrations, but manageable. The most I've traveled in a day is 650km...From bangalore to thiruvalla, covered the entirety in 9 hrs since i was in a hurry. I had maintained high speeds for hours without breaks, the bike didn't give any niggles, no loss of power. Brakes could have been better, lacks the bite. Plastic quality is okay after almost a year..No rattles or strange noises.  Stock tires are not the best.. The mrfs will slide when throttle is applied even on a dry corner, but the threads are intact after 21k... I suppose it'll run another 6k before it reaches the wear mark. Bajaj svc will insist on air filter replacement only after 15k, but the filter gets clogged right after 5k. Replacement is necessary then itself, but not a problem as filter element cost just 250rs. Brake pads too, were replaced every 10k, around 600 for both pads. No electrical or lighting issues till date..But that doesn't depend on the miles but only on the abuse of time. Time will tell how the vehicle will persist over years to come. So far, i'm happy that i spent my money on a reliable machine, which cranks right up every single day....Just hope that it remains as it is for the upcoming years.

Bajaj Dominar 400,4,Not for all  you see,"My eyes were on this bike from the very beginning, from the day it was launched.This year when it got all the upgrades and became much better i just couldn't resist anymore, so i went ahead and bought it.Phew,man i got so excited the moment i drove it from the showroom to my house.I bought it from khivraj bajaj who really made me confident not just for buying a better motorcycle but to also assist at their best in terms of maintenance and repair. This monster is not the smoothest till 1st service but after that it gets so better and makes the ride very exciting and engaging. Of course the bike looks absolutely awesome with it's bold and muscular appearance and with the new exhaust that it comes with,just adds a lot to it's  aggressive character. The bike is vibe free almost through out the rpm range until you push it to the highest rpm. The pull from the engine is just so good and addictive , no doubt people are cruising thousands of kms on it. My first service which was a free service along with engine oil change and other things costed around 1600 , which is reasonable for a bike like this. Regarding the maintenance, i do chain lubing once every 550 km and will always keep an eye on the coolant and engine oil levels. Also will recommend to wash/clean it regularly has dirt sometimes settles in really tight and congested places which might become very difficult to clean overtime. The advantages of owning this bike:1) you get a lot for the money you pay 2) performance is good at this level 3) long tours can be done on limited budget 4) engine is quite refined and response is crisp 5) low and mid range torque is fantastic for city rides. You may get disappointed by :1) very heavy at 184 kg (dry weight)2) heavy steering and not so easily maneuverable in cities 3) build quality ,has it could have been better 4) power output and acceleration even though it's engine is very much identical to the duke 390 engine. 5) mild vibes at higher rpm at foot pegs and handle bars.

Bajaj Dominar 400,4,View of mine on dominar 400,"I have a 2019 Dominar 400(Green). I like to convey the pros and cons I met.Pros :Dominar 400 is the best touring vehicle in its segment(below 3 lacks). It has superb initial torque. With twin barrel exhaust it makes us say wow! Even though it is a high-weight bike (185kg around) it never fails in pickup and effortless reach of top speed(160kmph). Design is best. It has the best riding position and which makes go long and long. Mainly dom boy makes his head turn while he roaring inroads. Really I'm enjoying myself with Dom.Cons:The main thing I disliked is tapped noise coming from the engine. Bajaj has to fix this issue.Even though it has a good riding position seat cushion is not the best at all. Due to its high weight, it does not pull at the initial as duke 390.

Bajaj Dominar 400,5,Mean and like to scream,"Bought the beast in august,2020 and at that time it was priced 1.95 lac(ex showroom). At that price point other available bikes which i have shortlisted along with dominar 400 are duke 250, himalayan, jawa perak. Now i will compare each of them with dominar 400.Duke 250 : absolutely stunning design and loaded with premium components from ktm. It is very good for city ride as well as it is lighter than dominar. But it lacks the raw power which i can feel on dominar at highway. With dominar i can cruise at 120 km/h effortlessly and have power in stock to overtake almost every vehicle in the highway.Himalayan : a great adventure bike at this price point. Tackle bad roads with ease. But i am not a guy who wants to stay in tarmac instead of going in offroading. In highway himalayan feels lack of power. It feels less powerful in comparison with duke 250 also. Other than that i was also little bit skeptical about servicing cost and reliability as it is a royal enfield product. Jawa perak : looks good with old school charm and black finish. Performance wise it lags in comparison with dominar, but i was ok with that as the look just amazed me. But later point when i get to know about jawa service center reputation and problem of parts in avilability and very few java service center in india in comparison of bajaj, i restrain myself from jawa perak.Looks, performance, riding experience : when you first get the bike and sit on it with your legs, you can immediately feel it is a heavy machine. But once you start the machine and it is on its wheel you can not feel that hefty weight anymore. Although you can feel it again in a u turn and turning radius is quite big for it. Other than that you will be always informed that it is a powerful machine and 40 raging horses are ready to be unleashed at a twist of your wrist but it will not provoke you for that unlike ktm 390 siblings.It is not a eye catchy like its other competitors in stand still, even some people some time get confused with my dominar (vine black) with my friend's fzs 150(matte black). But once you give a little of throttle to this beast, it's bassy exhaust will remind you that it is a powerful machine.You can cruise with that all day with great comfort, although the pillion seat is not on that level. It can tackle bad roads with its frond usd forks and overall soft suspension setup(its heavy weight also play a role here).Servicing and maintenance : being a bajaj product it is very easy and cheap to maintain. I have done first service with oil change, oil filter change, coolant top-up and basic servicing which cost me 1489rs to be exact. Other than that i do chain cleaning and lubrication in every 500 km which is recommended.Cons: the only problems i have faced till now is 1. It gets heat up very quickly in traffic. It is not extreme like duke 390, but still it gets pretty hot.2. In 3000-4000 rpm range it gets too much vibey. I can not feel much vibration in below or above this range.3. Rear brake does not justify with this bike. You have to mainly rely on front brake only to stop the vehicle. Rear brake has very less bite.4. Although it is a sports tourer, it get only 13 liter tank which is very less for a touring bike.5. It does not come with a center stand, even bajaj doesn't provide it as a accessories.

Bajaj Dominar 400,4,Long term bajaj dominar reviewr,After researching for long and test driving many bikes I finally booked dominar 400 in Ahmedabad. The booking process was very and test drive vehicle was available every time. Even before booking I test ride to confirm my decision. The waiting was about 20 days in my case. I brought this bike from gallops Bajaj. From booking to delivery everything went smooth. I got bike delivered in 2018 October. After bring home I noted that abs light didn't turn off even when bike is running. I went to Bajaj next day and they said it requires an ecu update and next day my bike was given back and now the problem was resolved. The bike performed really good and smooth. For first 1000 km's it was mentioned to not exceed 60 km's per hour. After 1st service this restrictions was removed. The service process was fast and first free service coasted me 1200 Rupee's. After the service I went to Jaisalmer with this bike and bike performed great even will pillion and fully loaded bags and everything. The bike glides at 100-110kmph. But between 5000-6000 rpm its vibrated a little too much specially on handle bar and pillion footrest. Every time i went to service it never coasted more than 1500 Rs. But as my bike crossed 20k km's . The bike needs some parts changes which will cost you around 10-15 thousand depending on parts. The complete chain sprocket needs to replace. Brake pads will be changed and filters etc. will be changed. All in all. My 2.5 years of bike and clocking over 20000 km's.

Bajaj Dominar 400,5,Absolutely Legendary !!,"First of all, I Am following Dominar from cs 400 concepts, its inspiring power delivery, throttle response, design, and aerodynamics... Makes it dominate the entire segment, especially since I love its seating position which is too comfortable. There are lots of pros which can be listed long, But I only find 2 cons: 1. Weight: Dominar 400 touring kerb weight comes to around 195kg (205kg plus with a full tank ) as am a  bodybuilder I find it hard to push or pull the bike in some circumstances(especially while pulling backward) but it doesn't hinder performance plus its weight is an advantage while cruising because it has rock solid road grip 2. Instrumental cluster: The console is a bit outdated, today's 100cc scooter gets Bluetooth connectivity, a wireless key and many more features. The secondary console is utter waste no use of it. The information it provides is insufficient.

Bajaj Dominar 400,4,About best budget tourer,People how are looking for a budget friendly bike for touring this is the one for them. the main disadvantage and advantage of this bike is its weight  due to its heaviness it stays in the road pretty well which is a good part as a tourer bike. but during  filtering through tight traffic it might be a issue for some people.The gear position indicator can't use during riding but this bike is in 400cc segment which for experience riders.  as a experience rider who need to look during riding.  the new suspension setup is good compare to old one. The bike got more detailing than the older one and   the bike it self says a  touring bike but the tank size and fuel range is disappointed that is why many budget tours choose thunderbird. bajaj need to concentrate in build quality in older models there is an buzz sound feeling issue in some  .

Bajaj Dominar 400,3,"Her name ""DOMINAR"" is enough because she craves for Dominian, not for a proportion. Well said by Bajaj "" Let's Dominate the Nine Realms"".","The purchasing experience was good, the salesperson treated me well and brilliantly explained the bike. Value for money, because its cheap and best in 400cc segment provided with high power of 40 PS, torque of 27 Nm, high-end electrical functions, and all other basic specifications and featuresWhen it comes to the riding experience, I must say it's fabulous, take it to any road or no road she delivers her best. Provides comfort to the rider and also the riding position is best than the rest of other bikes, and also provides comfort to the pillion regardless of speed, bike position in running, high acceleration, etc. This bike is also known as a sports tourer as it delivers very high power and torque, which makes it far much better than any of the bikes upto 400cc except KTM 390cc bikes.(FYI, Dominar 400 is not a track-ready bike it comes under the category of naked sports, so there is no point of comparing it with fairing body type bikes such as RC390, RR310, CBR250, R1, BMW RR310 or above).When it comes to looks, she is just like fire, burning up the ways. People get attracted to her muscular body at just a single glance. Of course, she is a head-turner.Performance, as I have already mentioned above she is the best in 400cc segment (top in Indian manufactured brands). It has been a year now I am riding this bike and have ridden this bike at top speed of 172, she was very stable and she can go max upto 180 on road and 195 on dyno machine. I have encountered severe situations where I had to apply panic braking at high speed, she was always my best friend during those situations and never disappointed me, breaking system of this bike is fabulous, and the dual channel ABS works the best to date. If you are good at handling, then you can control this bike as per your skills at any speed and in any position. This bike can be ridden on any kind of road as it provides comfort and the best shock-absorbing suspension.

She will survive more than 15 years. 

Few tips I would like to share:-

Always fuel up with extra premium petrol only (Speed, Power, etc as per availability).

Always use 4 stroke Motul 7100 T engine oil at intervals of 2000 kms (much better if you can get 7200 T which is rarely available). Please do not use bajaj brand engine oil, even bajaj recommends Motul.

Always get the chain cleaned and lubed at intervals of 250-300 kms. Do check whether the chain is tight or not, because it keeps getting loosened a bit at every 500 kms. The clutch should be tight as much as the bike starts marching when you release the clutch max to an inch from the handle.

Maintain tyre pressure regularly - front 30, rear 40.

Keep your bike always clean and all screws tightly screwed up for better performance.",16,9
Bajaj Dominar 400,4,Cons are heavyweight and not as refined as Japanese motorcycle,"Buying experience and services are not that good but I'm reviewing the bike itself has everything you need for touring ..On the highway it's awesome but at low speed, it feels heavy.

Bajaj Dominar 400,5,Just go for test ride and you will love it!!,"Good day, readers.I'd like you to get a cup of tea and read the entire review since it's going to be long, and you'll need it. You will not comprehend the points if you do not read the entire evaluation, and you will continue to buy foreign products as normal.It all started when i realized i needed to get a gear bike since i was tired of my honda aviator 110cc, which i had ridden for over 42000 kilometers in less than two years. I began looking for a bike that provides performance comfort. Yeah, you heard correctly; i didn't go for mileage since i knew I'd be buying a bike with at least 300+ cc that wouldn't offer me ml, so don't look for it because you might be buying 900cc or 1250cc and won't receive ml or else you'll buy that bike (off track but the mindset is important).I began researching other manufacturers and began visiting their showrooms to assess price points and other things. I compiled a list of four bikes, which i also discussed in my first youtube video.1) Himalayan 2021 royal enfield2) imperiale 400 Benelli3) the re meteorDid you notice anything unusual?... Yes, Bajaj was my last option. So i started looking at specs and anything else that was available online and offline. I started questioning friends about it, and i went insane. Yes, you'll have to be insane to get the correct one, and i was looking for performance and comfort with beast mode.After much deliberation and after visiting about 50+ showrooms of several bike manufacturers, i opted for the dominar 400.Now, most people would opt for re or Benelli or anything else, but i'll tell you what i was searching for in my bike.I was looking at engine power, torque, and comfort, and none of them could compete with the dominar 400 ug 2021 edition.Engine411 cc power 24.31 ps torque 32 nm mileage 32.04 km brakes tube for double disc tyresSpecifications for the royal enfield meteor 350Max power is 20.4 ps at 6100 rpm, while max torque is 27 nm at 4000 rpm.Front disc brakeFuel capacity 15 l body type cruiser bikes rear brake discBajaj dominar 400 ug 2021Engine 373.3 cc power 40 ps torque 35 nm mileage 26.50 km brakes Tubeless double disc tyreFinally, i opted for the dominar 400 because it can perform some off-roading, but the re Himalayan was meant primarily for off-roading, but the specs were still poor. It's not a bad bike, but you're paying your hard-earned money for it, right? of course, re Himalayan owners would be wild about this bike, and i believe they are correct, but at some point, you need torque.I believe the dominar 400 is an underdog bike, but trust me, it's a beast...Yeah, it's heavy and has some flaws, such as the tank not being made of metal, but every bike has some or other issue. Rather than sacrificing performance and power, i would go for a heavier bike.The dominar 400 ug version is one of the best 400cc bikes in its class... Trust me, compare it to any other brand and see what you get here. Congratulations to the Bajaj group. I'm looking forward to the dominar 600 or 900cc...",2 years ago,5,5,4,4,5,Tours,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,11,4

Bajaj Dominar 400,4,Dominate your zest... D400 way,"If aerodynamics and the zest to drive the machine was my way to explore a machine, bajaj dominar d400 was my answer to that quest. I have always sought to get my hands on a machine that works with the snap of my mind, not compromising on safety nor the style.Sturdy drive and aerodynamic style speak one word for me – d400. My requirement was to drive on the busy city roads with varied surfaces and at times on highways and that has been addressed by my red hot bajaj dominar 400. Commendable braking with abs, instant power of 33 hp, an easy shift of gears with slipper clutch, bright led lights through the dark nights, lit-up switch gears during night time, comprehensive reverse digital instrument console sans gear indicator (i miss that), and upright sitting position are few of my favourites on d400.Have always cherished the charm to drive this heavy-weight beast (i call him as it is designed like one) to work and long drive with my wife. I really wish that service points were made available in south mumbai which is currently missing. The closest service point is mahim. The service engineers are well versed with their work and have addressed even small issues when occurred. I really wished that bajaj would look at the possibility to have options for minor upgrades on my 2018 dominar with options of 2020 machine (mirrors, exhausts, upside-down front forks, and if possible the instrument console)Mileage although is not expected higher (it gives 20-25 in the city and about 28 on the highway).

Bajaj Dominar 400,5,Superb bike excellent,"Every bike is good, however it is just a match of your requirements against the machine. So my requirements were 1. Powerful engine at 40ps power revving to 8,500 rpm, you will never feel the power is less 2. Comfortable riding position: I had plan to use bike for long drives and occasional commute and for this purpose I would surely need a good riding position. Am 6 feet tall and this bike surely is very comfortable and you sit fairly upright with a good riding posture 3. Safety and comfort: dual channel abs, biggest disc pads in segment, slipper clutch, USB, mono shocks, refined bs6 engine you will feel you are driving a very safe and well planted bike, it did not seem to swerve or you will never hesitate to rev it higher and brake instantly. The bike will just be so composed to bring you to a standstill with no effort at all. 4. Latest tech although the speedo is not comprehensive as KTM. It certainly is not vintage which brings smile to my face. Also the all led headlamps are a beast, it illuminates even a black road to daylight. 5. Service cost: owned a pulsar all my life. Am aware Bajaj costs will be considerably less or moderate when compared to other manufacturers. Also the service interval being 5k km's, dominor does deliver for long haul and with few lesser worries so if your checklist of bike purchase matches mine do not hesitate to buy this phenomenally well-made sport tourer by Bajaj.",3 years ago,5,5,5,5,4,Tours,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,3-6 months,No Tips,7,2

Bajaj Dominar 400,5,The beast in the segment.,"This is going to be the complete review of bajaj dominar 400 till now. The buying experience was quite nice and decent for me but when we talk about riding experience, it's way beyond amazing, this is such a beautiful and comfortable bike in the segment with such power and the performance is the best in the segment with high-speed stability as it weighs about 190kg and we can count it as a basic/entry-level superbike. The looks are really great and muscular. The service experience is always great at the bajaj service station, and servicing costs around 2000-3000 as per the condition and your choice and it should be serviced after every 4000-5000 kilometers and I would suggest to get it done after 4000 kilometers and replace the engine oil at every service instead of topup. I was getting the mileage of around 25-30 kmpl in city traffic as per riding style and around 32-35 kmpl on highways.Pros:Road presence, high-speed stability, performance, service and maintenance cost, mileage, touring capabilities.Cons:Few vibrations after 5500-6000 rpm, pillion seat could have been of better quality to make it touring friendly for pilliion as well. I would really recommend getting this bike as this is the best segment bike with less price.

The bike is a pleasure to drive, and ofc there are vibrations, but manageable.I had maintained high speeds for hours without breaks, the bike didn't give any niggles, no loss of power. Brakes could have been better, lacks the bite. Plastic quality is okay after almost a year..No rattles or strange noises.  Stock tires are not the best.

Bajaj Dominar 400,5,First bike be the best one,"My purchase experience was pretty bad, to say the least. I was misled into thinking the my choice of colour available and after I made the payment, they told they didn't have that colour. Fortunately, another showroom associated with this one had stock coming in the same day I was going to take delivery, and I insisted on getting the colour of my choice. That apart, the bike was flawless from day 1. This is the first bike I owned, and I'm amazed to say the least. Moving from an Activa to a Dominar is quite the upgrade, and after having ridden other bikes in the segment, I'd say Dominar is the one that fit my bill perfectly. The RR310's riding posture is too committed, Duke 390 has look too lean and would look great beneath a rather fat guy like me. The Interceptor was out of my budget, and the Gixxer SF250 hasn't been released when I got this. Talking about the looks, it's just perfect. No other bike stands out so much as a 2019 Dom in Aurora Green. It just dazzles. The engine is punchy. The low end torque is lesser than that of the Duke 390, but it isn't the point of this bike. The great mid range punch is what makes this bike so nice to drive. City maneuverability is on the lower side, owing to the large turning radius and the weight. For some reason, the bike just isn't willing to roll in neutral, and feels way heavier than it actually is. It requires a significant amount of strength to manage it in parking lots, which isn't the case with heavier bikes like RE 350. My local Bajaj that manages the services is quite responsive. They regularly call up to check the running condition and take feedback on service. They also follow up whenever there's an ECU update, or a part recall or upgrade. The only con is the rear seat. I haven't had one person not almost fallen due to the rather flat and small rear seat. Also, the windblast past 120 is very bad, the bike could use a taller windscreen.",4 years ago,5,5,5,4,5,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,3-6 months,"Oil the chain every 500-1000km, install a pillion backrest and consider getting a taller windscreen.",4,0

Bajaj Dominar 400,5,Big bike with powerful heart,"It was an amazing buying experience for my new bike and the first one with my money (previous bike was gifted to me by my father) with bagga link bajaj , delhi. They are one of the largest bajaj dealer in delhi with wonderful and very knowledgeable staff.Riding this bike is a treat in itself what a wonderful machine it is. Muscular bike with abundant power and torque. Very easy handling and comfortable riding posture makes is even more worthy, it just glides through the traffic. On highways you can easily cruise at speed of 120 kmph-130 kmph. I choose this bike over royal enfield , i am a big fan of re but its tube tyres and the vibrations are  big problem for long rides.The seats a very comfortable and spacious enough to grab you and make you comfortable even if you ride all day long.The all led headlight of the bike is amazing and have a very powerful and long throw, gives good visibility of the road at night.Overall this is one of the best cruiser bike in this segment.The aurora green color of the bike which i choose is very eye catchy and gives the bike a very appealing look. All muscular body and all led headlight are the bonus which you get in dominar (not in re) and the most important thing is its all digital console which gives you all important information including the gear position.It have two different tft one usual on handle bar and the other which is on the tank(a smaller one).Bajaj is known for its cheap services and maintenance cost and so is with service of dominar , all the three free services were under 1500 rs.

Only cons about the bike is the service provided by the bajaj team. I faced a tappet issue within 5000 km and when contacted the service center they said the spare is not available.

Bajaj Dominar 400,4,Its not the bike but the rider,"I've owned this bike for a bit now and I've done more than 5k on it with 3 long ridesHere are 5 major pros and cons that I've told based on my experience. They might be subjective but here you go:Pros1. The bike looks amazing and has a good road presence, especially in the green color.2. Quite powerful and punchy with excellent high-speed stability. There have been times when I've cruised constantly at speeds like 140 for straight 50-60kms3. The bike sounds amazing especially past 6000rpm4. Headlight throw is quite good5. Good service networkCons1. The bike is heavy and the low-speed maneuverability in traffic is tough especially for a new rider because the front end is quite heavy.2. The bike heats up quite a bit at low speeds but it's expected from the compression ratio of its engine3. Rear brakes are honestly very bad, especially for the bike's performance. It cant brake as good as it can accelerate4. Mileage can drop down significantly if you ride it fast. In cities, I get 26-27 if I ride nicely. If you ride it fast it will drop to 23-245. It can be an eye-catcher increasing chances of theft and all so be careful with where you park it overnight and all, and I recommend riding carefully regardless of the bike but especially with these types. It's an amazing bike But I think every bike is good, it's just if it's for you or notAs we riders say the rider should connect with the bike the first time he or she sits on it.",2 years ago,5,4,5,4,3,Daily Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,Keep cleaning the chain.,3,1

Bajaj Dominar 400,4,A promising sports tourer,"I bought the bike just a couple of months after it was launched. It was quite promising as it offered all that i wanted for an amazing price. Though the showroom had limited stock we managed to get the bike registered and delivered in under 3 weeks.Pros:- 1) the bike is amazing to handle when compared to other tourers in the segment.2) it has good punch of power and torque when you need it, quite enough for indian roads.3) looks of the motorcycle were different and futuristic. It is a real headturner and the throaty exhaust just makes it more appealing.4) the headlight, although not very wide, lights up the road quite well and is quite bright aswell.5) the bike is loaded with technology, with twin displays, gear position indicator, liquid cooling, fi, abs, etc it is more than what you paid for.6) it might sound really weird but personally i felt more comfortable riding the dominar as compared to my classic 350. The seat has good cushioning and although i had to add raisers to the handle bar, the stock setup was surprisingly very comfortable aswell. Vibrations do creep in but are very minimal and dont bother you that much.Cons:-1)the build quality isn't  that great almost 13000kms into riding and there are alot of jaaring noises coming from the panels. 2) i just discovered that the front steering bearing needs to be changed every 10-15k kms as the handle tends to loose its smoothness. Comparatively other motorcycles dont need it to be changed for atleast 35-40k kms.3) the gearbox has a clunky sound to it, which has gone worse after a year of riding. 4) the service from bajaj (atleast of which i have experienced) is pathetic. I have hardly seen 1 or two svcs who are actually helpful and they resolve your issue. Most of the service centers have no expertise for working on the dominar. Replacement parts which are ordered take almost 2-3 months to be delivered. (and these parts are manufactured & get shipped from pune a mere 150kms from mumbai)Finally if bajaj sorts out the build quality issues and the aftersales service aspect. This is a very promising product. Although i am not happy about  bajaj going ahead with the dominar 250 as the dominar lineup was supposed to be a premium topend range. But it cannot  be denied that the dominar 400 is an amazing and comfortable tourer.",4 years ago,5,3,4,4,1,Everything,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,Stock tyres and the chain sprocket last for about 20000kms. And they have to be changed. To avoid spending alot at once change the rear tyre first as it wears out faster than the front and you can change the front tyre after about 2k kms more. Clean and lubricate the chain every 500kms & keep proper slack on the chain. Do not keep the bike covered all the time during rains as the metal parts might start to rust.,3,3

Ergonomics - excellent, the tubular one piece handlebar is little bit on lower side comparison to F250, provides excellent rider's triangle. Seat is excellent for rider as well as for the pillion. Pillion seat is broad and  seat compound is also neutral (not too hard not too soft).Engine and performance - great 250cc for the masses. Engine has great low and mid range grunt with little top end. No need of 6th gear cause the gear ratios are quite long. You can potter around town in higher gears with lower speeds. The torque curve is really well spread. Rev the motor above 3000rpm and the bike shoots like a shooting star.Bajaj has played really well with Pulsar 250 twins.Bajaj has 2 categories of motorcycles for indian market. Standard and premium. Bajaj has manufactured pulsar 250 for the standard market. That's why the price is low compared to dominar 250, ktm duke 250 etc. If anybody needs 6th gear, dual channel abs, wide rear tyre, fully digital console, liquid cooling system and dual channel ABS can opt for the premium category.

Bajaj Pulsar N250,5,N250; my first,"I bought the dual-channel abs version of this bike and what stood out instantly was the exhaust note, fire-led projector headlamps, and the mids. 21.5 nm of torque is crazy at this price point. I ride this bike for everything and am quite satisfied with the overall performance of the bike. There are minor issues; it's not exactly free revving so you do get vibes at the foot pegs and handlebars. The rpm analog meter is laggy, rvm stands are dated in design compared to the dominar 250. The engine refinement is stellar for an Indian brand. I was skeptical about buying an Indian brand but I love the punch it puts in the mids which means you would vroom past those metallic enfields in no time. The seating is great as is the suspension, ideal for Indian roads. Could have given that sixth gear. Anyway, it puts a smile on my face every day that I ride it and definitely delivers that naked bike vibe.",1 year ago,5,5,4,4,3,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,6 months-1 yr,No Tips,20,8

Bajaj Pulsar N250,5,The best 250cc under 2L on road,"The buying experience was pretty smooth and fast. Even though nowadays bikes come with a 4-valve engine this one feels soo smooth and better compared to the Apache RTR 200 4v for example even after being a 2 valve so had to pick this. Almost as smooth as a Honda. The black variant looks beautiful. The headlight is very effective and bright. Surprisingly it's more nimble than Apache which is 10 kgs lighter than this, so has surprisingly good weight distribution. Has a good road presence since it's not so common. The brakes are amazing and with the dual channel abs it is almost a complete bike with just one major fault in my perspective i.e. both the front and rear tyres are slimmer for a 250cc bike should've been a little more fatter for better road grip and could've instilled more confidence at higher speeds. You can easily cruise at 90-100 or even 110 kmph all day on highways without any issues. Could've had the option for Bluetooth connectivity and priced that variant a bit higher just to kill the competition. Gives decent mileage for a quarter liter bike of around 36-40 kmpl in a tier one city so bumper-to-bumper traffic is compulsory here lol. And you could get around 42-44kmpl on highways. One of the sanest purchases I made and I'm very happy about it since it's an amazing bike that isn't talked about much since it's a bajaj vs the Japanese competition in the 250cc segment. A new engine to compete against an already reliable one i.e fz25 and also launched at a time when petrol costs more than 100 RS a litre so has a long way to go to prove itself but it's worth the money and a beautiful machine nonetheless.",2 years ago,5,4,5,5,4,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,No Tips,18,9

Shocked by this, he replaced the battery, but the issue recurred later that night. The following morning, we demanded a new bike due to the persistent problems. After a lengthy argument, they assigned a service technician from Bajaj to inspect the bike. It turned out that the battery connection was not properly plugged in, a clear case of human error.

Bajaj Dominar 250,5,The all rounder,Handling the bike is good even though the weight is on the heavier side. City handling and gear shifting are far too better than d400. It costs around rs.47k less than d400 in on-road price. Bike is getting heat when we rev the engine harder for longer distances but while driving i didn't felt the heat that much. Turning radius could have been better. I commute daily and go for long drives too. Seat is not as comfortable as i would've expected for long rides. Pillion doesn't have proper foot rest which i expected in saree guard and pillion sitting one sided will not be comfortable to hold the hand grab. Fuel level indicator and average mileage per trip would be useful which are not there. I don't mind the absence of gear position indicator. I'm 5ft9in taller and i have no difficulties with height of the vehicle. I could move the vehicle without any difficulty. But footrest will be disturbing if you are less than 5ft6in while moving the bike even though the footrest is foldable due to its position. Mirror view is too good. Moving the bike in lanes are too easy thanks to the smaller tyres when compared to d400. Mileage is not attractive but it's not bad either for this type of bike which is around 30 to 34kmpl based on the roads. Headlights are the best which is best in class in my point of view. Quality of plastics used are better when compared to yr15v3 which my cousin owns. The bumps are pretty obviously felt but it's not completely transferred to the body. Felt no body pain after long travel and city travel. Exhaust sound is louder but likeable. None of the cons made me to rethink from buying this bike because all are negligible and most commonly neglected. I'm not just tourer. I use the bike for city use mostly. Budget friendly.

Bajaj Dominar 250,4,Finally a power cruiser worth every buck!,Got this bike last week. Too early to comment on mileage and maintenance. But engine being new mileage is something around 27 to 30. Expected to increase after first service. Very refined engine. You will love to rev the throttle. Looks wise and feel wise almost same as D400 except the power. Its very stable on highway and very comfortable for long tours. If you have a budget within 2 lakh this is an excellent buy but for the segment its a bit expensive. But worth every penny. As a first time buyer I was confused what to get but finally this is what impressed me the most. If you love riding within 80kmph to 110kmph go for this. Because that's the sweet spot of this bike.,4 years ago,4,4,4,3,4,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,Do not rev the engine to unnecessary speeds.

Bajaj Dominar 250,4,Worthy dominar sibling,"I was upgrading from a 200c bike. I was biased towards the dominar 400 right from the day it was updated in 2019, with more torque and power, added features etc. But I shortlisted few other bikes as well. My initial plan was to purchase a bike in 2020 but due to the pandemic, I decided to postpone. Fast fwd to march 2021, I still had dominar 400 as my favorable option. But by then bajaj released the dominar 250, re-released their 2021 himalayan. The other available options were gixxer 250, fz 25 nd a very surprising mahindra mojoBefore the 2nd covid wave which started in April, I had test ridden both the dominars from 3 different dealers in bangalore, the himalayan but in bs4 avatar, gixxer 250 sf and mojo.Test ride experience:1. Mahindra mojo: absolute best experience when it came to testing riding. That's why its on the top. I did test rides from two different dealers. Both of them provided me with close to 45 mins to an hour of test ride. That much time is enough for anyone to understand the bike. How it feels, how it suits one's riding style etc. Mojo is an absolute treat to ride. Excellent build quality, awesome sitting comfort both for rider and pillion, good initial pickup and clean power band, 20ltrs fuel tank, exhaust note course a treat to ears. The 110 and 140 section tyres were well-deserved fit. Well, the front cowl and headlamp might be debatable but it's not that bad. Looks unusual and eye catchy.Mojo was leading in the contention because of very unfriendly and short test rides provided by both bajaj and re.Reason not to consider mojo: well if you ask someone about mojo, mostly you will get a no. For me, it was no different. But I got very good feedback from mojo owners directly. I had prolonged calls and conversations with 2-3 mojo owners before i even decided to purchase it. I was convinced after the test ride and ownership feedback. Mind here, the ownership reviews were not just online articles, i had 1-1 calls and chat conversations which suggested a strong case.But after all these, the final offset was the price. The mojo costs around the same price bracket with dominar 400. Feature wise mojo has bit less features and the console pretty dated. Specs wise definitely dominar, but we don't always ride spec sheet. We ride the bikes, so specs were not a cause of concern. The financing was.From april 2021(new financial year) hdfc stopped financing mahindra 2wheelers. It was a telling blow. The dealership person also tried from his end. His earlier financing that were initiated in the last week of march got cancelled by hdfc. I tried to get financing from axis, icici, kotak but all of their roi was much higher as compared to hdfc. By that time the 2nd lockdown enforced which subsided the purchase plan again. Spoke with mahindra personnel in the interim who is the regional head of karnataka or south india (i don't exactly recall) but nothing fruitful. Finally dropped the plan of purchasing mojo with a lot of dismay .2. Re himalayan: test ride experience so-so. I was given a bs4 test ride bike which was brutally abused. Clunky gearbox, heavy clutch but still a good riding posture. I have ridden my friend's himalayan so i knew the test ride bike was pretty much belted.  Most of the other nearby dealers didn't had the 2021 himalayan. All of them were offering bs4. Quite disappointed. On top of that, no 6th gear, no liquid cooling, heavy clutch, spoke tubed wheels.. All of these were also a point in cancelling the himalayan as well 3. Yamaha fz25. Cheapest in terms of price.Least powerful of the lot. Though i liked the seating comfort. But too laidback in performance.4. Gixxer 250: light footed, flickable but wasn't too comfortable with the seats nd stiff suspension. 5. Dominar 250/400: the test ride experience isn't that great from bajaj dealers. Offering only few metres of test ride to sell their products is a real joke. I have been to 3-4 dealerships in bangalore namely khivraj nd amba. All of them had the 250 nd 400 test bikes but all of them allowed hardly 100 metres of test riding which is not sufficient enough to make a purchase. Afterall it's our money that we earn nd spend. So at least we should be able to test the vehicle to be able to make a decision but who can give advice to bajaj dealerships!! Why i am focussing on ""bajaj dealers"", because they are the only ones along with re who provides utterly dismal short span of test rides.Coming to the dominar siblings, i rode them back to back on well paved nd broken roads around the showroom. Felt stiff at first , plus managing the weight took bit of adjustment. They did allow to test ride with pillion so that was plus. But the short span didn't convince me at all. In the subsequent weeks, i test rode the dominar from other dealerships as well. No one was able to provide a long test ride. All of these bikes had some pros nd cos as per my requirement but the final two contenders were mojo nd dominar.The 2nd lockdown provided me enough time to think about these 2 bikes in the long run along with the spares availability, service support nd etc. The mojo was already cancelled due to financing issues. I was only left to choose either the dominar 250 or 400. I wasn't too fond of 400 due to nvh levels nd heating issues, plus the weight nd less fuel efficiency. Made up my mind and then after 2nd lockdown was lifted, the nearest bajaj dealer spoc contacted me to get confirmation about the booking. I informed him that unless they provide me a longer test ride, i won't be able to book the bike. Why the dealership spoc called me because during the lockdown period i had asked him if he can arrange for a longer test ride (8-10kms).After few days he again called back to inform that he has the approval to provide 8kms of test ride. I was atleast happy because they tried. Since i was working from home, so it wasn't a problem. Went to the showroom within an hour, test rode the bike through the orr (outer ring road bangalore). The route was intentional because i know how bad is the road condition given the potholes nd damaged roads. The bike handled it well and my pillion was also comfortable. Came back to showroom and booked the bike.Within another 1 week, the financing was processed and on 7th july, i was handed over the bike.The riding experience is very satisfying. Enough grunt nd power to reached triple digit speeds. No engine knocking at lower rpms, no false gear shifts Definitely heavy but slowly it gets used to. I am able to manage the weight now without issues.Seating comfort is good, riding posture is relaxed. I have been to multiple short rides ( solo nd with group). The bike keeps up with the pace but yes outright you can't match the pace with ktm duke 250 or dominar 400. I reached 120kmph twice for few secs on the empty bangalore mysore highway. Post 120, i felt power lag but that was mainly due to pending 2nd service. I am sure now if i try it will cross 130kmphI have not tested the mileage but my understanding is it should be around the 30kmpl mark.Looks wise the red nd black color looks dapper. I am planning to get a ppf coating done to preserve the shine.",1 year ago,4,4,4,4,3,Everything,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,"Keep the chain clean and lubed (700kms interval)

Bajaj Dominar 250,4,A review of dominar 250,"Well hello !! peeps if you came to read about the dominar250 review read till last paragraph.First, we will discuss about my experience and review of dominar 250My odo: 10,800kmDesign& aesthetics (looks). 4/5   this also depends on people's choice but for me, it is great god!! look at those headlamps and that design genuinely feels like a big bike.And there are two colour options available black&red so depending on what you like pick one I choose black cause it's more like a 400 . If you're not picky and looking from a far-off distance or at a glimpse you can't really differentiate between 250 or 400 if you opt for black and those tyres do look well!! on it . This machine will grab a lot of eyeballs for sure! and that exhaust man i loved it and probably the main reason to go for it and you need not go for aftermarket things cause stock one does the duty very well. So ya it's a good-looking bike overallSuspension &brakes: (4/5)Well coming to this the front forks handle very well at almost every small-medium scale potholes so no problem as such from the front end. But the rear end is a bit stiff as you know it's adjustable u can adjust that for your liking make sure you do that while taking the delivery caused the stock set-up is a bit stiff. But even after adjusting you won't find a large difference but a little but enough of that so overall rear suspension is a downside though. Don't expect that with this set up you can corner or flick like a street fighter cause due to its long wheelbase it's pretty hard. So don't take this to extreme corners and also don't run this into big potholes cause you may end up in seal breaks of front suspension cause these are usd they are a bit sensitive in comparison to telescopic So careful cause this can end in burning your wallet.Coming to the brakes this is equipped with dual channel abs so no wheel locking it works pretty well. Where it impressed me a lot .. At first, I thought due to their weight these brakes may not have a bite but I was proven wrong as they have a great bite so no problem with that.At low speeds, these work great and even at 60 you can get into standstill after 4-6secondsComfort: (3.5/5)Well, it happens with almost all the bikes with stock settings as seats are not great. Even on this one but it can handle 200-250km in a single stretch then you keep getting cramps and butt ache so better go with air seats.So not everyone goes for long tours daily so for commuting this offers more than enough comfort.But for pillion, this setup is uncomfortable for even intermediate riders like more than 70km as you won't have a grip for a pillion to rely on although this one has to grab rails their function is limited.And if you are planning for a triple (though it's illegal) but in case of emergency then don't even think of it cause you won't even have proper space to get seated.  If you're a solo rider then no problem but if you are travelling with a pillion then it's a bit irritating .. I rated it low cause this bike promotes itself as a tourer.For the tourer, comfort is the highest priority both for the rider as well as the pillion. Cause almost all my pillions felt uncomfortable Practicality:(4/5)Here we discuss the mileage&luggage capacity it can carry and its maintenance. Well, mileage depends on how you maintain and ride your bike so it varies from person to person so if you an intermediate guy who revs occasionally then probably you may end up getting 25-27 km/lin city /town on the highway this may go up to 30-33 km/l don't expect this to be an economical bike that gives you 40+ km/l.So I am a gentle rider so I fare about 30-31 km/l on average. Coming to luggage carrying capacity you can have a tank bag and strap your extra luggage on the back with chords. But the bungee straps are much to no use if you are going with more weight like post 15kg cause mine are torn when i went for a ride with 23kilo strapped from them so try to change or you can tie bungee chords around you can also pick any accessories of dominar 400 cause those can fit with 250 as well like saddle stays windshield /knuckle guards etc..Performance:(4/5)As this is a 250cc motor don't expect this to perform like the ktm s or Husqvarna it's rather a gentle one but has a super strong mid-range pull post 4k till 8k it pulls like mad...!!!.And also this engine feels smooth by bajaj standards. But sadly engine feels sluggish at lower speeds and I feel like there is a lack of punch from 2-3k rpm . It's a mid-range motor so don't pull this to the extreme you may end up getting high vibes. Bajaj tried really hard to tune the nature of the engine and somehow succeeded to an extent but not completely. It does still feel like a ktm 250 at times.(if you on 60 kmph in top gear and need to overtake a vehicle then you won't find acceleration immediately you need to downshift then you can proceed) .This but for cruising this one is like heaven for it here the weight factor is a major plus cause this makes the bike more touched to the road so no crosswind issues you can cruise smoothly from 70-90km/hr through the day you won't find any complaint from the engine also the gearbox is smooth and slick u won't end up in getting false neutrals and all that stuff and the addition of slipper clutch also boon to this so this works great and a 6 th gear always good for touring. Cause it's more like a cruising gear you won't find pull from it but keeps the revs down and smoothens the engine.And also u can go at higher gears at lower speeds in city traffic scenarios with no fuss in the motor. Personally, I haven't touched post 100km/hr but my friends did that and had no complaints till 120km/hr but post that vibes kick in from almost every part (i am pillion in these scenarios) . Coming to top speed my friend made about 142km/hr on the odometer.Features: (3.5/5)Here we get a ton of practically no-use features like, tell tale lights of secondary display like big bajaj logo and low battery indicator, fi failure &bungee straps that are of limited to no use . Although there are some features that are good like a side stand cut off. And all led layout which offers good visibility even at night . What I personally feel bad about is there should have been a gear position indicator.Also the rear tyre could have been improved.As a beginner and intermediate rider, you won't find any trouble with tyres but mrf's are mrf's so if you do wanna change then u can go. But for me the stock tyres are good and offer a decent grip.Verdict:If you wanna grab one that looks &feels like a big bike in the below 2lakh segment and has touring capabilities along with city friendliness then this is the bike you should go for. Also the value you are getting for your money is also good.",2 years ago,4,3,4,3,3,Everything,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,"Check for an oil leak, near the gear lever as it leaks frequently after a long drive.",17,4

Bajaj Dominar 250,5,“Dominar 250: My Unwavering Choice”,"In Pursuit of Dominance: My Journey with the Dominar* The buying experience largely depends on the dealership and your interaction with them* The riding experience is “so good as butter.”  But a riding glove is advisable and mild vibrations are felt at specific speeds & RPM* The Dominar 250 offers a smooth and enjoyable ride, both on highways and in the city* While it may not have the sharp aesthetics of some other bikes (like KTM), the Dominar still looks cool.* Servicing and maintenance depend on the service center you choose. Choose a reliable service center.  Always refer to the owner’s manual for service details. Cross-check the services performed on your vehicle.* Bajaj’s separate service personnel for Dominar bikes are commendable.* However, if the experienced Dominar service staff are unavailable (due to leave or other reasons), it can be challenging. Minor issues during servicing are common across brands. The same applies here as wellPros:Weight and Stability:* Feeling the weight initially is normal, but you’ll get used to it.* The Dominar’s weight contributes to stability on highways.* Those who dismiss the bike due to its weight might miss out on a hidden gem.Weight-Performance Balance:* Despite its weight, the Dominar 250 performs admirably.* The bike’s weight doesn’t hinder its overall performance, which is a positive aspect. Side View Mirror:* Well-designed mirrors enhance safety and convenience.Riding Position and Exhaust Note: * The stock-raised handlebars and riding position contribute to rider comfort.* The exhaust note, particularly in lower gears and at idle is a beautiful rhythm.* Even if you don’t consciously notice it during city rides, pillion will appreciate it. For a biker, it makes their day awesome!Moderate Electronics: * If you prefer a bike with fewer electronics like me, the Dominar 250 fits the bill.* It features dual-channel ABS and an ECU, striking a balance between technology and simplicity.* Unlike KTM bikes, it doesn’t overwhelm with excessive electronic aids.Headlight:* The Dominar 250 comes equipped with a powerful headlight that provides excellent illumination and is sufficient for most riding conditions.* Unless you’re venturing into extreme foggy areas in Himalayan regions, additional lighting modifications are unnecessary as white headlight in snow doesn’t make sense there.Cons:Rear Tyre Profile:* Comparing the Dominar 250 to other bikes in the same segment or Yamaha’s 150cc bikes, the rear tire profile is smaller.* While you may not notice this during regular riding, some riders experience cornering issues.* Keep in mind that tire conditions play a role, and upgrading beyond the manufacturer’s recommended size isn’t advisable.* Manufacturers have dedicated R&D teams who understand what’s best for the vehicle.Parking and Turning Radius:* Manoeuvring in tight spaces can be challenging due to the high turning radius.* Not a daily issue but worth noting.Windshield and mobile charger Absence:* Excessive wind can be tiring during long rides.* If you prefer the stock visor from the Dominar 400 Adventure Kit, it’s a good choice compared to aftermarket options.* At least the mobile charger could’ve been included as this is a sports tourer bike.Rear Brakes:* Rear brakes might feel spongy.* While some sponginess is common in heavy bikes, Bajaj should definitely improve rear breaking in future models* Skilled riders often use a combination of engine braking and both front and rear brakes for effective stopping. so, act like a pro!Ground Clearance:*Ground clearance is subjective and depends on individual riding styles and preferences.*Personally found it adequate, even during mild off-road rides.* The bike’s built-in protection helps prevent any exceptional significant hits to the underbody.On my journey from Coimbatore to Hyderabad & vice versa, I was 101% satisfied with it. Before selecting D250, I test-drove Gixxer 250, vstorm 250, and fz 25 were not available at that time, as Hunter, Himalayan 411, 450, and Scram 411. But the Dominar 250 stood out. Its performance, comfort, design, and versatility convinced me—it’s the one.  It might be subjective. Have a comparison and go on your preference.

Do chain lube once every 500 kms/ after rain.
As Bajaj's recommended engine oil change frequency is every 10000 kms. It's better to change it after a very long continuous ride of 3000 - 4000 kms or every 5000-6000.
Check for the level of engine oil, if it's low just get 2x100 ml of oil from auth.spares and top up it. (check it once in 4 months/ before/ after long rides).

Bajaj Platina 100,1,Bad mileage,I purchased new bajaj platina 100cc in oct 2018 from harsha automobiles suraram. From the first day i am facing a problem of low mileage. I am getting only 55 kms. Mileage while they promised to 85kms. And company advertising 104 kms. Since first servicing i complained about bad mileage. But showroom and service center not giving me any sustainable answer.

Bajaj Platina 100,4,economical thriller,"I mostly drive alone and i have been driving it for the past 3 years mostly for my regular college commute and for small trips in the vicinity for shopping and other work purposes, that makes it a commute of minimum 50km/day. The most interesting thing about me riding this bike is that i have never filled the bike with fuel of above rs.150, mostly rs.80 is what i spend for fuel everyday. My commute is mostly on highway (nh 47) so bike gives a decent fuel efficiency of 60 - 65 while cruising on 70 to 60kmph. Suspension is strong and reliable but not good for demanding comfort over potholes.Have drove this bike over 3kms of potholes for 2 years every day.(because of construction of a flyover en route towards my college). Driving over the deep potholes is a terrible idea with this bike, it literally is a pain to drive this bike over potholes but dodging those potholes with this bike is literally an adventure because the bike is extremely light and it never takes an effort to dodge those potholes, it becomes even more horrible to drive this bike over a pothole with a pillion. The bike is no looker or a ride which a college student would prefer citing the current trend where looks matter for a bike. I drive and love this bike only for the reason that it is extremely cheap to own, maintain ,economical and adventures for day to day commute. (given the fact that it saves a whole lot of pocket money for me) it is much more economical to drive this bike as compared to travelling on a busy public transport bus. Most loved fact of this bike for me is that riding it at 80 to 90kmph is like driving a sports bike at 150kmph.The only cons i would like to mention would be poor shock absorption over potholes, poor driving position ,( it is painful for the back and shoulders to drive the bike for long rides, if u just cruise at speeds) but the pain is however not felt while doing some crazy revs.Extremely unsafe at high speeds say 90kmph because of poor braking. To counter that i use engine braking (never had any issues with engine, brake or clutch ever).As already mentioned not a stylish bike.Bottom line owning this bike for me as a college student is just an ""economical thriller"" rather than a conventional bike for daily smooth use which has no adventure or economy or fun.Thank you.",5 years ago,1,5,3,3,5,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,"For safety from accidents of Tyre Bursts, Change the tyre to tubeless.

Bajaj Platina 100,4,Mileage killer,1. After all when go to buy a new bike the smile always remains constant and happiness is at the peak. The day was good and dealer was too good. The bike was great with almost everything prefect.The dealer made my day and finally the bike was mine. I had a great experience buying there i feel i made a good choose choosing that dealership. 2.Well genuinely after ridding for 1 year i got the gear on the bike. Riding experience is good i will give 3 star out of 5. The only problem is faced is the handling of the bike can be better the handling is too bad. The front  suspension push the handle too badly when u go through some pot on the road. Braking system also need to be improved. Other then that very thing is great.3.The looks is average and u can't except it to be more because the bike itself is designed for light weight and i think thats working.Great performance it saves a lot of petrol the mileage of the bike is unpredictable. 4. Its not a bike which requires a regular maintenance. I use it daily purpose and hence i need to maintain it. Well i just to service center every 2nd month just to ensure that everything is fine and every time i go the  maintenance fee is not more than 600 - 1000.5. I think the fibre body of the bike can be a problem because after some time the body start vibrating and starts making sound as to reach a good speed Additionally when u are riding at 90kmpl and suddenly a truck overtakes u the bike tends to become unstable..Again the mileage of the bike is simply awesome. The weight of the bike is too good that a old can also have it because it doesn't give u that much of extrusion to body.,4 years ago,4,4,4,5,4,Daily Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,"Use tubeless tyre,

Bajaj Platina 100,5,My Opinion,"Bajaj platina was my first bike. The only bike in its segment with good looks, features, less price & most importantly mileage. The first thing any middle class person will prefer is high mileage from his bike in college days. I used this bike around two and a half year then i gave it to my uncle so now he uses for his daily commute. To be honest i am around 6 feet tall and platina doesn't suit me so i switched to pulsar 220. So if you are a tall guy i recommend you not to invest in this bike. But if you are looking for mileage its the perfect bike for you. When i was using the bike it used to return me about 85kmpl which is now degraded to around 82-83kmpl after so much of use which is not bad. If we talk about the looks, its quite simple but way better than the other brands. The bike is sleek and can cut through traffic easily. Power is the only thing you would feel less because of its 100cc engine which churns around 8 bhp i guess but still the performance is good. I didn't liked the seat as it was bite uncomfortable to ride on a hard seat for long rides. But as the seating position is straight up right you wont feel any pain in one hour of riding. If maintained and services properly this bike will serve you the best it can give. Spare parts of this bike are easily available anywhere and also in cheap price. In case of servicing bajaj service centers are very poor. One thing i noticed is that the fitting of the headlamps is bit loose. If not covered in rainy season water enters inside the headlamp. Not yet sure from where does the water accumulates inside it. I will suggest bajaj to look after this issue.Pros -1. Good mileage2. Better performance3. Sufficient braking power4. Reliable5. Best for Indian roads and traffic jams6. Good handling7. Less maintenanceCons -1. Stiff suspension2. Hard seat3. Lacks disc brake4. Poor headlight5. Vibration on handle bars & foot-pegs6.

Bajaj Platina 100,3,Simple sober & best Indian commuter,"Bajaj platina was my first bike. The only bike in its segment with good looks, features, less price & most importantly mileage. The first thing any middle class person will prefer is high mileage from his bike in college days. I used this bike around two and a half year then i gave it to my uncle so now he uses for his daily commute. To be honest i am around 6 feet tall and platina doesn't suit me so i switched to pulsar 220. So if you are a tall guy i recommend you not to invest in this bike. But if you are looking for mileage its the perfect bike for you. When i was using the bike it used to return me about 85kmpl which is now degraded to around 82-83kmpl after so much of use which is not bad. If we talk about the looks, its quite simple but way better than the other brands. The bike is sleek and can cut through traffic easily. Power is the only thing you would feel less because of its 100cc engine which churns around 8 bhp i guess but still the performance is good. I didn't liked the seat as it was bite uncomfortable to ride on a hard seat for long rides. But as the seating position is straight up right you wont feel any pain in one hour of riding. If maintained and services properly this bike will serve you the best it can give. Spare parts of this bike are easily available anywhere and also in cheap price. In case of servicing bajaj service centres are very poor. One thing i noticed is that the fitting of the headlamps is bit loose. If not covered in rainy season water enters inside the headlamp. Not yet sure from where does the water accumulates inside it. I will suggest bajaj to look after this issue.Pros - 1. Good mileage2. Better performance3. Sufficient braking power4. Reliable5. Best for Indian roads and traffic jams6. Good handling7. Less maintenanceCons -1. Stiff suspension2. Hard seat3. Lacks disc brake4. Poor headlight5. Vibration on handle bars & foot-pegs6.

Bajaj Platina 100,4,A GREAT COMFORT PLATINA,In my city the buying experience was very good. I asked them to suggest a good mileage and comfortable bike because I belong to a village so for that reason a comfortable bike was necessary.

I can say Platina is a good choice for comfort.It looks pretty decent and performance is good overall a decent package but there is something that isn't good is its parts are properly not available in the market so that makes very angry me sometimes but I can say for that price point there are no cons in this vehicle. But something that I noticed is - it makes vibration after reaching some particular speed limit like 80km/hr.- its headlight is not very good on the road.- it's gear stuck sometimes.- after a certain year overall experience decreases.I am very happy to tell you my experience.I am attaching photos that are not of my bike because I am out of my Village so please don't reject it.,30 weeks ago,4,5,5,3,3,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,Just make sure you visit service centre in sometime so that bike never give up your expectations,4,0

Bajaj Platina 100,4,Platina at its best,"While I've never been a fan of motorcycles that sip rather than burn away their fuel, i have to admit that i'm quite intrigued with the bajaj platina 100 es. Bajaj claim that this little 100cc motor will sip on one litre of fuel for the better part of 97 kilometres, inching ever so close to the 100kmpl mark. Since most motorcycles give a higher figure on the highway mileage run, we might actually cross that magic mark - this test should be fun. Bajaj has also strengthened and optimised the frame that has allowed it to shed an impressive five kilograms and shortening the wheelbase by 20mm. Ground clearance has increased to a healthy 190mm which should help keep the engine dry in the rains and safe over really bad roads.The new technology and lighter weight have allowed for a very efficient engine. it's a comfortable motorcycle with a typical upright riding position that we've come to expect from commuters.

As it happened to me i took this bike for a ride just in a week it was noisy and i felt something wrong with engine so i went to service centre and they told me you should have rode at 30 or 40 km/h for three months. Nonetheless i payed.Servicing and maintenance cost is low.Pros include only one thing that's mileage that too at low speeds. Low weight.

Bajaj Platina 100,5,All in one features available,"Style easy to ride, nice features and looks different in the crowd (of 100cc bikes).Engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox engine: engine has reasonable power and pickup but little lower than similar bikes of hero and honda. But the trade-off is its awesome mileage.Fuel economy: i was able to extract 88 kmpl maximum and currently getting around 81 kmpl in city riding that includes heavy traffic.Gearbox: it's smooth. No false neutrals unless the engine oil goes dirt black. Gear ratio seems optimal for the power of the bike.Ride quality & handling i have done numerous long rides on the bike. Not a single time there was breakdown. Even long drives of 100 km at a stretch does not fuse engine provided you drive sub 60 kmph speeds (that's what the bike is designed for).For city driving, handling is great. Very easy to drive through traffic. Engine starts the first kick every-time. Final words this is for you if1. You are not hungry for power and speed.2. You need it for daily commuting from city traffic and occasional long drives.3. Mileage is your primary constraint.4.

Had to control the urge to twist my wrist. 1st stop was petrol bunk as the bike was in reserve. One should have looked at the people drooling. Metallic gray paint with dash of red colored suspension and rim stickers and few stripes. This bike is all you need to turn some heads and hear some wows. After around 7 months of riding it in and around Bengaluru, here is what my experience.Pros1. Awesome looks. 2. Refined engine but still gets some vibration around 4-5k rpm3. Great acceleration. 4. The bike feels very light in terms of handling despite its light weight. Not meant to do zig zag in traffic but has decent maneuverability to get you past stuck cars. 5. Turning the bike is a bliss with the low seat height. (i am 5'6"")6. Works like charm. Braking is decent enough to stop bike from 70 km/h to 0 in less than 20 meters in dry conditions7. You won't need 4,5,& 6th gear in city.Cons1. Overall mileage is good. Much less than claimed. It might be due to my riding style.

Bajaj Platina 100,4,City rider,It is one of the best city bikes that i ever used. Bajaj has its own way of building mileage bikes and platina tops in this segment. Very comfortable for city rides which times less than 45 hours. Will definitely get 85kmpl if you maintain a speed range from 35 - 50 kmph. Service and maintenance are done at an interval of 3000km. I have driven almost 35000km in 3 years span. And in my opinion platina is really good for short distant rides. And not suggestible for long rides.

It gets decent looks but the tail could be a bit more stylish but still it is good. Performance is one thing which amazes me. I could go 95 kmph on highway without much vibration. It couldn't be compared with sports bike but still it is great considering its price.4. If you ride it decently there will not be much problem.5. Pros:- Good average mileage.

Bajaj has priced platina very competitively ex showroom price is 55382/- delhi. If u get any platina owner on the roads just ask him about the bike and mileage definitely you'll change your mind.

Bajaj Platina 110,5,Honest review!!,"Hi my parents gift me  bajaj platina 110cc im using  more than 1 year i give writing my opinion  for those who ready to buy platina 110.Pros:1.Engine:platina producing a good power and torque and its light weight so its cruising easily on 60-70 its enough for city riding.For better performance i recommended 10w 40 or 30 motul or shell. Dont use 20w series for platina.. I recommend to change engine oil every 3000kms for better engine life.2.Comfortable:its comes with nitrox suspension and front long travel suspension no words its simply amazing.When compare to splendor and other commuting bikes platina suspension was good.Handle bars are upright its very very comfortable.3.Design:bajaj  improving features day by day for platina even pulsar series does not.Design its good enough for commuting bikes.4.Low maintenance:crossed more than 1 year i didn't do anything for my bike just changing engine oil and general service.5.Price was decent  rs 76,452 onroad chennaiCons:1:milege:some people thinking platina give 80-90kmpl  yes but its not suitable for 110 cc go for 100 cc. Platina 110cc power increased but mileage decreased its gives you average of 50-60kmpl(my riding speed 60-70)2.Brake:platina comes with asb system it will apply both brakes at same time front brake bite was good but rear brake its not working properly after cleaning brake shoe also.3.Quality materials.Materials are quite decent not perfect some materials are cheap quality but enough for low price bike.4.Highway:initial pickup was good but lag in high-end and whole bike get  vibrate.We have to maintain 60 speed to avoid vibrations.Thanks i hope its usefull!!!!",3 years ago,4,4,4,4,4,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,64,16
Bajaj Platina 110,2,Worst mileage 47-50kml. Worst pickup bike as ever,"When you plan to buy this platina, first thing you have kept in mind that it will give you average mileage around 65-75km/l. But actual result is very worst 47-50km/l after having all services. If you live in hilly or valley area, where you have to ride on inclined surface, it will harass you. It will not give you that pickup by you can easily ride, if you have pillion rider, definitely pillion have to get down. It's maximum speed on smooth surface is 82km/h. I have to recommend that you can purchase pulsar 125cc or any sporty bike if you're young to ride. If you bought it, you'll regret.

Bajaj Platina 110,3,Not as fuel efficient as expected,"I bought this bike on 13th August 2020. The main purpose of buying this bike was to get a fuel efficient bike for city riding. First impression was the bike is very smooth and comfortable. Before first service I got a mileage around 50-52kmpl which was not satisfactory for me. After the second service am getting around 60kmpl. The company claims a mileage of 70 km/l so I expected at least 65kmpl which is not the case here. It has a reliability issue as I have seen. It makes rattling noises when run over potholes. I am a bike enthusiast and I own three more bikes (apache 160 2v, Fzs v3 , NS 200). None of them make such rattling noises. Even I don't run over potholes at high speeds, I ride between 30-40km/h with my platina  hear.",3 years ago,4,3,5,4,4,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,6 months-1 yr,Service your bike timely from authorized service center or your trusted local garage mechanic.

Platina now comes in two variant cbs & disc brake both are very good for safety in slippery roads. The build quality is very solid and value for money products.

Bajaj Platina 110,5,Very nice bike,"1. Buying experience: i got the bike within 1 hr however the bike has run 4kms (could have taken a fresh bike)2. Riding experience: i am 5.4 ft, so this bike is just enough for me to handling with 805 mm seat height, however it would be better to have Overall riding comfort is better than other commuter bikes.Rear suspension is adjustable, so i adjusted to loosened to maximum. After that, i didn't feel the jerks of small speed breakers.3. Looks & performance: it looks like a normal commuter bike but not much stylish (i prefer non attracting bike :p). 9.81 nm torque @ 5000 rpm is great for pickup, looks like i am riding a 125 cc bike. I also analyzed the rpm and speeds at which the bike gives maximum pickup:1st gear: 13-28 km/h(3000-7000 rpm) 20km/h@5000rpm 2nd gear: 26-50 km/h(3600-6400 rpm) 38km/h@5000rpm 3rd gear: 42-61 km/h(4100-5900 rpm) 52km/h@5000rpm 4th gear: 58-72 km/h(4500-5500 rpm) 64km/h@5000rpm 5th gear: 65-75 km/h(4700-5300 rpm) 70km/h@5000rpm. Above is not exact, but approximate value with 95% accuracy.So, cruising at 70km/h also gives me maximum mileage.4. Service & maintenance:1st service done at 580 km. At 3300 km, i changed the bajaj stock oil to motul 5100 10w30 (semi synthetic) as the vibrations were too much even after riding just 5 kms. After 50-100kms of usage, the bike became much smoother.2nd service done at 4926 km with no oil change.Currently crossed 7300kms, no problem faced with vibrations as motul is doing its job very well. Only did top up at 5500 km (100 ml) and 6500 km (80 ml). Oil level dropped due to aggressive long rides.5. Mileage: need to be very careful for this, as it varies too much. Avoid filling petrol from bad pumps located at highway, instead, use ones inside city. Also, before going for long ride, tune the carburetor from bajaj service center or from an expert mechanic. Tune the carburetor every 1500-2000 kms, if you do long rides. (bs6 version does not need)I was having carburetor jam problem and getting mileage of 50-55 kmpl. Then used stp moto booster (2 treatments of 10 l with each treatment, after each treatment, carburetor re tuned). Now getting 74-78 kmpl at city and 78-82 kmpl at highway.6. Pros:Good comfort and adjustable handle bars & rear suspensions.Good low end torque.Refined engine.Better mileage.Low maintenance.7. Cons:Seat height could be lesser.Pickup reduces with pillion, but ok. Need to take care of mileage.",4 years ago,3,5,5,4,4,Everything,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,"Avoid filling petrol from bad pumps located at highway, instead, use ones inside city. Also, before going for long ride, tune the carburetor from Bajaj Service Center or from an expert mechanic. Tune the carburetor every 1500-2000 kms, if you do long rides.

For oil change, it can be extended upto 10000 kms (with top up at every 1000-2000 kms), but since the default engine oil is a mineral based, so extending to 10000 kms may be not so good if doing long rides, in that case use a good semi synthetic engine oil (like motul 5100 10w30).
Oil grade: Do not use higher grades like 10w40, 20w40, 10w50, 15w50 or 20w50 (mostly recommend by local mechanic). Use only 10w30 grade (5w30, but not  available in Indian market).

Bajaj Platina 110,4,"Comfortable, Reliable with best mileage.","The buying experience was good. I live in Rohtak and bought it from Ansh Bajaj. I knew that I was going to buy a Bajaj Platina 110. Firstly, they said 87500, but after negotiating with the manager, I bought it at 86000. The riding experience is good according to its engine. It's seat comfort is great, even in long rides. You can sit with the pillion easily. The suspension setup is good. Looks are typical, not that great But if you're a person who just wants to go from point A to B without caring about mileage then this is a good choice for you. The front disk break with the ABS is amazing, even at high speeds it can stop the bike without any skidding. The rear brake is average. Engine performance is good, pickup is also good. It can carry heavy weight easily without any problem. If I talk about mileage then you don't need to worry about it. Even at high speeds, it can give mileage up to 70Kmpl. And if you ride it to get the best mileage then it's mind-blowing. It can get the mileage of 78Kmpl. After the first service, it gives good mileage. Service interval is very good. You have to complete 120 days. or the mentioned kilometers: 1st Service, 500-750 Kms/30-45 Days. 2nd Service, 4500-5000 Kms/240 Days. 3rd Service, 9500-10000 Kms/360 Days. The service charge is not that high. And I clean the chain every 500 km. The Platina 110 is known for its exceptional mileage, consistently delivering around 70-80 kmpl even in real-world conditions. This makes it a very economical choice for everyday commuting. The bike has a long and comfortable seat, an upright riding position, and good suspension that absorbs bumps effectively. This makes it ideal for long rides and urban commutes. The 115cc engine is smooth and refined, with minimal vibrations even at higher speeds. This adds to the overall comfortable riding experience. The Platina 110 H-Gear variant comes with a 5-speed gearbox, which helps maintain low engine revs at higher speeds, further improving fuel efficiency and reducing engine stress. Bajaj has a vast service network across India, ensuring easy access to spare parts and service centers.Affordable price: The Platina 110 is one of the most affordable bikes in its segment, making it a good value for money option for budget-conscious buyers. The Platina 110 comes with minimal features compared to some competitors. It lacks modern features like a digital instrument cluster, alloy wheels, and disc brakes on both wheels. The 115cc engine produces only 8.2 Bhp and 8.3 Nm of torque, which may feel inadequate for highway riding or carrying heavy loads. The bike is not very sporty or exciting to ride. It is best suited for relaxed commutes and is not meant for aggressive riding. Some users report concerns about the overall build quality and fit and finish of the bike, which may not be as good as some competitors. The Platina 110 uses a simpler carburetor-based engine compared to some competitors that offer fuel injection, which can impact fuel efficiency and emissions.",35 weeks ago,4,5,4,4,5,Daily Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,8,3

Bajaj Avenger Street 160,4,Avenger 160 - can you ride like god on a budget,"So starting of with the buying experience , the salesman was somewhat disinterested in the sale but thankfully the manager actually came and helped us out. The delivery was on time but the accessories and their fitting was shabby and they misinform about all the accessories they include, so i would suggest everyone to double check the same but other than these issues the delivery and purchase was smooth. Now coming to the first ride quality, it is smooth and so very comfortable. The seat is like a sofa set and you'll not face any comfort issue . The only issue as far as comfort goes is for the pillion rider as the bikes suspension is a bit uncomfortable for the pillion rider. Also the bike is surprisingly easy to navigate through dense traffic and takes on corners well. Coming to the looks , people do turn around to check the bike out , it looks exciting and modern and will totally fetch you some compliments. To explain in short , the bike is smooth. Having used older generations of the avenger , this newer generation is way more refined and smooth compared to older generations. The bike does start vibrating a lot at higher speeds (60+) which is uncomfortable to a certain degree. Servicing and maintenance is really easy as bajaj now has an app to book servicing appointments and their turn around time for servicing is decent (same day) . As far maintenance as an owner goes , cleaning and keeping the bike shiny is easy using basic products available on amazon. One needs to clean the chain every once in a few months which your bike technician will tell you and do for you on your first service. To summarize the pros and cons Pros  : 1. Great design 2. Good quality components3. Amazing rider comfort 4. More refined motor 5. Decent mileage (42 kmpl for me)Cons : 1. Analog instrument cluster 2. Pillion rider seating uncomfortable3. Vibration at higher speeds.",3 years ago,5,5,4,4,4,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,3-6 months,Use moto shampoo and polish to keep metal shiny or may look very dull and clean the chain and lube it every 3-6 months depending on your ride frequency.,15,5

The maintenance depends on the rider because i ride my bike with care, so maintainable is less. I tried this bike to a top speed of 120km/hr.

Bajaj Avenger Street 160,4,Nice bike,"I'm writing this after riding 6000 kms.I had Bajaj platina 1000 (2013), which was a nice decent family bik giving about 75-80 kmpl. As I rode 75000 km in it, I thought of changing it. I sold that at a decent price of 25k. I was searching for an alternative with a higher power, similar mileage budget bike. So I visited every showroom and took test drive of Hero Passion, Honda shine, Bajaj CT100, TVS Raider, Yamaha fascino etc. Though I made up my mind to Raider, My wife suggested I not to think about budget and mileage and at least now I have to think about my passion and pleasure. So my interest shifted to higher cc bikes. However, you know, a middle-class, middle-aged guy, earning a limited salary,  can not leave the conservative mentality.  I wanted a stylish, bigger bike that looked different from conventional bike designs, with more power but decent mileage. Hence I purchased Bajaj -Avenger 160 Street.I purchased the bike with a single down payment in cash. The showroom did not have this bike in stock. They took almost one month. That was the only glitch in the purchase.  RTO has not given RC yet even after 3 months of purchase.Design and comfort:Design is different from conventional bikes. It grabs the attention of the crowd. The bike has less ground clearance. Though in twin humps it is problematic, for a person like me with an average height of 5'2'', it is very convenient as leg reach is good.  The seat is wider, but a little harder. The back suspension is 5-step adjustable and very good. No bumps or jerks are felt from the rear suspension. However, due to the oblique placement of the front suspension, small bumps and jerks are felt on the hands. But it becomes soft after riding 2-3k  km. A wide sporty handlebar is easy to manoeuvre, but for me, it leads to a bad posture for riding. This led to back pain for some time. But after getting adjusted to this posture and doing some stretching exercises, now I don't have back ache. Bajaj should give 2 options. The cruise handle is easy to reach and ride posture will be more comfortable than this. Now we can alter it by ourselves at the cost of about Rs.2500/-Riding and mileage:I ride app.75km daily in a 4 lane highway. In a single stretch, I rode about 180 km also.  Every time I test the mileage. Till today I got 49km to 55km per litre at the speed of 60-90 km. Breaking is very good. It stops immediately without any drag/skid even at the speed of 80kmph. Front disc brakes with single channel ABS does this job. Rear drum break is also good.  After strick running in for about 2k km, I rode once upto 110 kmph. After 80 km speed a vibration is felt in the handle. Initially, bike vibrates a lot so that you cant see any images in the mirrors. But vibration reduces after every service. Now after 2nd service, handle vibration drastically reduced. However not stopped. Bike feels very comfortable at the speed of 60-80. Road grip is excellent due to wider tyres. Gear shifting is smooth except first gear. We need to move the bike a bit (forward or reverse)  to apply 1st gear.  Since we can lift at 2nd gear, I usually skip applying 1st gear due to this inconvenience.Pros:design, look, mileage, ride quality, acceleration.Cons:Ride Posture, 1st gear shift, vibration.Overall experience:You will certainly love riding this bike. Mileage is also good for daily commutes. So I will recommend this bike for those who are upgrading from 100-110cc to bigger ones but are short at budget.",19 weeks ago,5,4,3,4,4,Daily Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,3-6 months,Proper running in.

Bajaj Avenger Street 160,5,Total love accepting all failures,"The buying experience was great. I’ve been driving this vehicle averaging 50 KM every day. The driving comfort is excellent and the handling is smooth and exciting.  It gives me a mileage of 50 KM per KM if I fill 5 liters. And if I fill for Rs 500  the mileage will be 45 KM. I have been using this since 2018.  Every bike has its drawbacks too. Avengers make a lot of fuss in the morning.  And while applying brake one should be careful to use the hind break first else you will fall.  The bike gives a missing frequently which could not be rectified.

Bajaj Avenger Street 160,3,Bajaj Avenger Street 160 Review,"I am using this bike since last 1 month. Following is my feedback Look of bike is good. Good ground clearance  Grip of tyres on road is good. bike is comfortable only on smooth highway roads. It is not comfortable during street riding. Shockers are extremely poor quality. Even if you drive on normal speed breaker at very slow speed of 10-km/hour you will feel jerk in your arms. Shockers will collapse completely. And at 20km/hour, you're engine may hit the road. You will feel vibration in hands. Bike needs more radius during turns. Breaks are effective only when you use both the breaks. And if you need to use front break in emergency at a speed of even 20km/hour bike will not stop and you feel jerks. Mileage is around 40km/liter, Clutch and front breaks are hard. Buying experience was okay. from dewan bajaj (rating 3/5) First service experience was Okay (rating 3/5). Riding experience was Okay. You feel an average bike experience. My personal suggestion is go for Royal Enfield meteor if you can wait for 6 month (this is the waiting time) and afford 80k more. Avenger 160 is an average looking bike.

Bajaj Avenger Street 160,4,A pseudo cruiser cum commuter bike.,"I have been using this bike for the past 7 months and covered 3500+ km with this hence I think now it is sufficient time and usage before reviewing the bikeI bought this after testing it for barely 5 minutes, the soft suspension and less noisy exhaust note led me to buy this as I wanted comfort over performance. Overall bike is good for city rides and sometimes long rides. Smaller jerks it can handle but u can't take it to bumpy roads otherwise suspensions will hit (with pillion ride).Pickup is decent up to 60 but after that, it takes time to reach 80+.Smooth cruising is around 70kmph and vibration in the mirror can be seen from 60 itself but on the handlebar, it can be felt around 70+.I'm 5.7 and for me, the sitting posture is not comfortable which I started feeling just after a few days of buying.For a ride of 20+ km or 30+ minutes back hurting and tail bone hurting starts. Seats are not comfortable (less soft seats) more worse for pillion as those seats are extremely small.Seating postures are not comfortable (the angle between the spine and thigh bone is very low for the rider), which makes me slide back and forth to adjust the stress on the backbone. Apart from comfort, everything else is ok. Mileage I'm getting 40 to 45 something.Once tried to take it on hills where it struggled to climb (me with a pillion total of 150kg and no luggage).But I'll appreciate one thing about the bike is that it is running well without any issues till now with little washing cleaning and servicing (at the service center only) Just a few days back the starting motor started malfunctioning which should be replaced under warranty.As the front of the bike is too long which makes it hard to maneuver in city traffic, as well as for standstill traffic it becomes difficult to pass through smaller spaces as it takes more space to turn.Overall I can't say I am very satisfied with the bike as it failed the purpose of comfort for me.

Bajaj CT 110,5,BEST EVER DECISION TO BUY THIS BIKE,"When I bought this bike, everyone's first question was why this bike? Why not Royal Enfield or KTM or a sports high-end bike since I can afford them too. I was a 22-year-old back then. Most of the youths at this age have a craze for superbikes or a cruiser. I too wanted to buy one then. But then I also wanted to make it run for a minimum 10-15 years. I have seen people complaining about either high maintenance or limited service forcing them to either sell their bikes or keeping it unused after some time and switch to four-wheelers. Knowing that the maintenance and service cost will be very low along with the fuel charges thanks to its amazing sixty-nine kmpl mileage, I knew I am betting on a long race horse and not an infatuation driven by adrenaline. I bought this bike 2 years ago and use it daily for 15-20 kms daily commute. It is a very reliable bike and very rarely gives trouble. People may say this bike is just for rural or for delivery people but i disagree. It is an all-rounder which can be used on highways and for long trips as well. I have done five hundred kilometres up down in a day with this bike including Mumbai Pune multiple times. I have travelled from 0 metre sea level to 1200 metre above sea level. On road or off road or on river bed or highways, you name it. Yes the 115cc engine may feel insufficient at times when you are climbing uphill with a pillion rider but this is a very small disadvantage which can be overlooked since you will be doing that only four to five times in a year. Apart from that, I really wish this bike could have given us tubeless tyres and disc brakes but I guess at its price point, it is what we can get. Almost half the cost of iPhone. The best part part about buying a Bajaj bike is its wide service network which is really really essential if you are planning to keep a bike for 10-15 years like I am planning to. Some of the problems that I faced with my bike in my last 2 years with this bike are tyre puncture (once), battery got discharged and had to be replaced and the carburettor jets to be replaced (happened because of bad quality of fuel). Not being a fanboy of this bike but it can happen with any mechanical object and its upto the user to take good care of their bikes. Speaking about pros, is the very long wide comfortable seat which can easily sit three people or two people with luggage in middle. There is saree guard on both the sides and leg rack on the both sides. Yes it may feel useless addition but trust me when in long rides the throttle becomes hot, there is a chance for rubber sandals to melt or legs getting burnt and this protection is very handy. There is an engine guard in front which prevents rain water from front wheel to enter the engine. Another small part which makes a huge difference in increasing longevity of the bike. The other thing which prompted me to buy it is the rubber flexible tail lights and indicators. Many a times during parking or incase bike falls down, there is a danger of them being broken but in this it doesn't. Long story short, if you dont care about looks or extra glamorous digital dashboard in front and just want a raw bike which can tackle all types of roads or off road, I highly recommend this monster bike!",10 weeks ago,4,5,5,5,5,Daily Commute,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,"Always fill good quality fuel regularly

Bajaj CT 110,4,Low price best ride,"I have purchased this bike for office work and daily routine work. No doubt it performed better in my experience. One problem is that it is a heavy bike and it is difficult to drive for a new rider or a rider who is still learning how to ride. Initially, I purchased tvs sport bike for my initial skills of bike riding and then I switched to this bike. The riding experience is good but due to its weight. It is difficult for a new person, after 60kmph or 70kmph it starts vibrating. I think bajaj should work on this. Mileage is undoubtedly excellent it gives mileage of 80kmpl. This is nice for me because I have only office work so I use this bike for up down daily. The bike has the best mileage and good engine but its building quality should be better. Its maintenance cost is cheap and service centers are available in our neighborhood. The overall bike is good those who want a bike for daily purposes can go for it, remember if you don't have bike skills then you can switch to another bike.

Cons (according to me) - Rear part of the bike looks very empty because of the skinny tyre, no hugger and underbelly exhaust. - No muscular looks like old 150 or any other pulsar but I am happy with overall looks. - Almost 0 storage space under the seat- Suspension is soft (could have been a little stiff) - Slightly overpriced than rivalsOverall I am happy with P150 it fulfills my sport with commuting biking needs but personally, I would suggest going with N160 if you are a young college student or someone who is looking for a muscular-looking bike.",1 year ago,4,5,5,5,5,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,No Tips,17,7

Nice riding posture so that you can easily manage to take reverse too. Engine is so powerful that the bike starts to run when you leave the clutch. 5 speed gearbox has long range of speeds and you don't need to change the gears again and again.Only thing i felt bad was its seat.

Bajaj Pulsar F250,4,Pulsar F250 11 months ownership review,"Buying experience - I had to buy a 2 lakh motorcycle after selling (due to back pain issues) my Bullet Electra Twinspark 2014 in December 2022. Apart from F250/N250, I considered motorcycles like the Hornet 2.0, FZ25 & R15S, Xpulse 200T 4v and Apache 200 as options. Didn't consider RS200, NS200 or 220 since they're dated. Test rode all options in Jan 2023 and immediately realized that no other bike in the segment is providing such a plush ride with decent handling. It also fulfilled most of my other requirements as well. Without much delay took a dual channel unit home in Feb 2023 for around 1.75L on-road Thane.Riding experience - After riding a long-stroke RE engine for years, it took me some time to get used to an over-square engine and also to F250's long turning radius. But once you get used to this, this bike becomes fun to ride.Looks - Subjective. I wanted some sort of fairing but not too wide like the RS200.Performance - Power and torque are sufficient for cities and highways. The bike is stable at triple-digit speeds. There are vibes post 100kmph but we rarely get to cruise above 100 on Indian roads. But the vibes are manageable during occasional top-speed runs. Fuel efficiency is very good for a 250cc motorcycles. You can get 33-38 kmpl in the city depending upon road and traffic conditions. On highways, this gives above 40 if you cruise between 70 and 90kmph. Efficiency starts to drop after 90kmph. For instance, if you cruise at 100kmph constantly you'll get around 37-38kmpl. LED projectors are decent too.Servicing and maintenance - My running is not too high, I have got 2 free services done. 1st free service with an oil change cost me around 800 and 2nd service with an oil top-up costs 400. Bajaj's 20W-50 oil by the Gulf is not the best for highways. Gets black at 2000 km. I recommend Motul, Idemitsu or Shell. Overall maintenance of any bike depends upon the rider's riding style.Pros - 1. Good power and torque delivery, good suspension.2. Awesome brake bite and feedback from both the brakes in dual channel ABS unit.3. Aerodynamic fairing.4. Good headlight throw.5. A good semi-digital meter console that provides adequate information.6. A combination of a comfortable riding posture, great fuel efficiency and 14-litre tank capacity gives a riding range of more than 500kms on a single tank easily which makes it an efficient tourer.7. Spare parts availability is decent.Cons - 1. RVM on the fairing panel vibrates even at slower speeds and lower RPMs (I've installed NS200 RVM on the handlebar).2. Plastic panels are a lot better than before but still need improvement. Stickering peels off too easily.2. Being a good tourer, it must have had a display for maps and navigation.3. Bajaj service centre people aren't good everywhere. I had to change my service centre since the one associated with my dealer didn't even listen to my issues/feedback properly.4. Noticeable vibes under the rider's seat after 7k rpm. But doesn't stop the motorcycle from pulling further as such.Can't recollect any other cons.",40 weeks ago,5,4,5,4,5,Leisure Rides,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,6 months-1 yr,"Use better oils than OEM on any vehicle if highway use is more.

Bajaj Pulsar F250,5,Great for city and highway,"1. Buying Experience:- I bought my motorcycle from raj bajaj in Byculla location, Mumbai. The buying experience was great. The staff was very cooperative and answered all my queries.2. Riding experience and performance:- The riding experience is amazing and the performance is also good. There is adequate power to ride on the highway. The gearing is also long enough that I never felt the need for the sixth gear. The bike would cruise comfortably at 80-90 kmph.3. Cons:- It might be for my model but I faced fueling inconsistency and sometimes the throttle would shut down for 1 second and pick it up again. Also, my abs sensor was not working properly as the abs warning light would randomly light up and would go off. The problem was fixed by the service center personnel.",2 years ago,5,4,5,4,4,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,3-6 months,No Tips,10,4
Bajaj Pulsar F250,4,Budget-friendly beast,"I haven't purchased this product yet but I'll tell you everything that I learned in the span of 30-60 minutes of riding it. So let's start with handling you may feel a little weight on the handlebars if you came from lighter motorcycles also you may get surprised to see how well balanced you can ride at slow speed or you'll love to ride it on the highway to get ever stable experience at high speed or on triple digits. Secondly, the push, the power, and the torque are there from the start that you might just go out of control but I would suggest do not do that cause it's risky. I was surprised to see the smoothest engine paired with a light clutch and smooth, effortless gearbox. Once you rode it you can't unseen the affection bike throws at you, making you go wild with her but I didn't ride it on the highway I rode it in city traffic so overall handling and performance are so damn practical. Also, I will always prefer faired motorcycle over a naked one cause it gives extra stability at higher speed and also may help you get fewer windblasts by having a windshield. Talking about appearance and looks this one is my favorite cause when I rode it in the city the ones who asked me which brand or which bike is this looks familiar or they got a huge smile when I told them that it was from bajaj pulsar, the twins as low as 1 lac 40k. Also, the engine sound attracts everyone on the radar they have to turn their head to make sure they heard her right. And yes the seat comfort is well paired with mid suspension as you won't feel little potholes cause this machine glides through all of that I only felt the speed breaker other than that the riding experience was quite effortless. Like just spin the throttle a bit and you'll get enough power to filter through traffic as well as fuel efficiency around 40-45kmpl after the 1st service as mentioned by my friend who owned it since April. Believe me, once you test rides it you'll immediately fall in love with her as she comes within your budget and provides you great fuel efficiency with enough power to maneuver here and there. I doubt you'll feel the need for 6th gear cause I didn't feel that urge to go on 6th but trust me you can say that it's a budget-friendly beast!!! also if dual channel abs were there then experience or dependency could have been better but you can go for alternatives like dominar 250 or rs 200 they come with liquid cooling & dual channel abs but are not so budget-friendly as f250. I rode her in between the hottest time of the day 12 pm to 1 pm and I didn't feel the engine is getting overheated. There wasn't this problem as such but if you are someone who doesn't care or love your bike and only sees her as a machine to go from one place to another then she'll get the issue due to your riding style. I would say ride her with care and love she'll give you what you expected as well as unexpected.",2 years ago,5,5,5,5,4,Occasional Commute,Never Owned,No Data,Never owned,"I would say go for MRF zappers or if you don't care about mileage then you can use 140 section rear tyre which will be helpful in cornering. Also, the bike is superb at handling the department you'll love it.

Definitely better than ns200 or 220f in terms of performance although looks are  a bit subjective i did not personally like it , but as millennial say , looks don't matter.Definitely a proper all rounder motorbike with enough to get you all over India and still be light on your pocket.",2 years ago,3,5,5,5,4,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,< 3 months,Do not cross 6k rpm for the first 500kms.,10,5

Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,3,Owning an avenger is a rollercoaster ride.,"Avenger cruise 220 is one of a kind cruiser in India. I personally has always been a fan of low height bike for cruising due to which I chose avenger to be my first bike in Feb., 2021 and bought it from local dealer taking delivery on the same day. Since then, it is used as a daily commute vehicle for a daily travel (on highway road) of 75 kms with an average mileage of 50 kmpl. Achieving this mileage requires quite a lot of pampering to bike like lubricating the chain every 500 kms, cleaning air filter every 1000kms and a weekly wash. It has a 220cc engine which is considered all good when compared to Royal Enfield bikes but the pick up gets compensated due to its lesser weight of 165 kg.As reported by others it does ride smoothly until you reach the speed of 75 kmph. After that the body starts vibrating making it feel like you are forcing the engine however, I've touched the speed of 104 kmph on the same vehicle. The bike has a digital meter which has a bluish backlight that turns on with headlight. During daytime since the headlight if off, there is no backlight in digital meter which sometimes makes it difficult to read the meter while riding. In my opinion since the meter is digital, the company could have also provided gear indicator in it. The first service was done after one month from the date of purchase. After completing a few kilometers following 1st service the virtual display started showing engine malfunction light due to which i took it to service center as recommended by user manual provided with vehicle. The service center deleted the error code using bosch toolkit and assured me that the problem is solved. However, the same error popped while riding, compelling me to take it to service center again. To solve this, they changed the o2 sensor in my 3rd visit to service center which proved to be a temporary solution. I informed the center about the reoccurring problem and they told me that the ecu of vehicle will be changed (after a wait of 15 days). Hence, in my 4th visit the ecu changed and engine malfunction light was gone.For a while (after 2nd service on my 5th visit to service center) the bike rode smooth as a geisel until it stopped suddenly at a speed of 70kmph on highway with heavy traffic volume during peak rush hours leaving me stranded. Before buying this vehicle, i did a lot of research on its bs6 model which helped me self-diagnosing the cause of problem. It was found that the side stand sensor fell off (the bolt provided in side stand sensor is very short due to which the nut got loosened with time and fell off) while riding which made it impossible for bike to run (refer function of side stand sensor in bike). I had to hire a tempo to transport my bike (metaphorically a dead fish in water) to service centre (6th visit). It took about 15 days (again) for the service center to solve the problem as they didn’t have this part too in stock during which the bike stayed at centre.After riding for 2 weeks from receiving my bike the engine malfunction light popped up again. I again informed the service center and they asked me that the wiring need to be replaced which was also out of stock and I had to wait for 15 days. As the time of truth came (7th visit), the wiring was replaced with new one which proved to be a fruitless solution compelling the mechanics to again replace the wiring with old one. Ironically, replacing the new wiring with old one did the trick.The 3rd service (8th visit) was done in the month of November before 10,000 kms following which the engine malfunction light again showed up decreasing the average mileage of vehicle. This time it was found that the throttle body need to be cleaned (9th visit) and so they did.Overall, apart from so much inconvenience caused by some design flaws of bike I like riding avenger cruise 220.",2 years ago,4,1,4,5,3,Daily Commute,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,No Tips,22,2
Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,3,Poormans harley davidson,"Looks: totally subjective. Wish a more beefy fuel tank.Buying experience: average. Riding: very comfortable, i must say, on of the most comfortable seats in this price range. Seat is broad and well curved for support and movement. But pillion seat could have been more wider. Pillion comfort is not very good like rider comfort. the part i want to talk about is gearing, well.... I dont like the gearbox. Its okay, but not like yamaha or suzuki gearboxes. Shifting doesn't have that feel and accuracy. Very short gearing ratios, becomes cumbersome in city traffics, for example, 1st gear upto 10 to 15kmph, 2nd gear 15 to 25kmph, 3rd gear 20 to 35 kmph, 4th gear 30 to 50,55kmph, 5th is beyond 55kmph. So needs very frequent gear changing in city. Its not like gixer 250 where 3 rd gear is all u need in city.. If gear shifting is not done properly, bike doesnt pull and engine starts knocking. Simply, in city, you will be busy with gearbox. So city riding is bad in this bike with traffic. Also every gearing has sweet spot where there is minimal vibrations.During highway speeds, vibrations come beyond 70 to 80kmph. Upto 65 kmph, it gives smooth ride. So, if you are enthusiast and love to rev the engine this is not the bike. Go for gixer 250 or duke 200,250. Its a cruiser bike and it is for those who love highway relaxed cruising. But if we compare it to royal enfield classic 350 or thunderbird 350, avenger 220 is much more smooth engine. No vibrations on mirrors upto 80 to 90kmph. Servicing cost is cheap. Takes almost 600 to 700 rs for one service. Fuel economy is okay. Depends on how u ride the bike, gives best economy when, 55 to 65 kmph at 5th gear and 35 to 40kmph at 4th gear... Gives upto 32 to 35kmpl if ridden carefully. Don't rev hard and brake aggressively if u want more mileage. One very bad thing is bajaj did not provide rpm meter in avenger, but pulsars have rpm meter. Always try to ride below 4000rpm to get relaxed ride. I achieved 120kmph top speed, frankly it should not be done. I thik, upto 80 to 90 kmph speed is safe and adequate.Quality of parts are not good, well its cheap in price also compared to duke 200,250 nd gixer250. Many parts tend to get rust in rainy season.I have faced one gross issue with this bike, battery went down and i had to replace it with a new exide 9v solid state battery of 2000rs, at that time, lockdown was going on, so did not get any customer support. See, my bike is only 8 months old, and this battery issue is not expected from a bike of this price. I have also heard about battery issues of avenger from other guys in fb group. Replacing it with new battery has resolved all problems but this should not have occurred in first place within one year of buying.Headlights are decent and looks badass from distance.I recommend if u want to go for it, then take street bcs street 220 gives tubeless tyres. But cruise 220 gives more raised handlebar and upright posture.In mountains, best is 2nd and 3rd gears to pull this bike uphill.Pros: very comfortable, relaxed, big bike feeling and minimum vibration(compared to enfield bikes), also low seat height is good for short riders and novice riders, long seats help during bag packing in back seat.Cons: long base, so handling is not great in traffic, narrow streets and bad roads, cornering is not confidence inspiring, brakes are average and low end torque is not good.Verdict: its a bike for mature riders who loves comfortable speed highway cruising and touring, not a good performer in bad roads but absolutely gem in highways. Wish it would be available with dominar 400 engine and premium components.",4 years ago,3,4,3,4,3,Everything,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,No Tips,27,9

Believe me friends, once I drove 998 kms (from Delhi to siwan) in just 16 hours with a break for lunch of an hour at lucknow without tiredness.At this price it feels a real cruiser.

Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,5,Bajaj avenger 220 cruise,"I have been riding this bike for 4+ years now.Comfort. 5 stars.I usually drive from vellore to chennai which is~150km that i use to cross without stopping anywhere so you can think with your other bikes within this distance how many times you have to stop to relax your back and burning butt. Lol. It really feels like god/so good.;-).But its not the same for the pillion rider your butt will burn like you are in hell. At first with back rest you will find it very very comfortable but not for so long due to narrow rear seat you will find the burn.As pillion rider my score will be 2 stars since most other bikes even rider will have this comfort only.:pControl: .4 stars.For control, this bike will always do what you say and you will never lose your control in this bike but the thing is you should know how to tell so one star less.The original back brake comes along with 200 was bad, you have to stand on it to stop but pro biking had later changed mine to 220 type brake system(it cost me 1500rs) with some rework(it looks like original fitment) now its very good.Braking only back brake will skid easily even at less speed at roads with even slight sand on it. So you have to apply both in same phase and it will control its speed even at 120km/h very easily.Its no good for taking curves with high speed and more slanting it will cause waviness and lose control.It will not fall down so easily.Even if you missed your control at some time still you can easily manage it control without falling down.Handling its very very easy and comfort. I been using this for a quit long time now.But first time when you drive this i can remember my experience, it will take some time to take control of this since you know this bike front wheel is quite long from the rider compare to other bikes.After driving other bikes and first time when you sit on this bike you will feel like your are under earth but later you will find the comfort in it.The gear shifting is so smooth it will never make a noise.Its cruiser so the acceleration is not very good you have to drive in high rpm if you want to race with other bikes.After 80km/h speed it gives vibration but it is still ok to drive to 100km/hr with full control.You could reach top 120km/hr speed very easily but after years it can still reach 110 easily but 120 now hard to reach for me after 5 years.Fuel conception.3 stars. To my experience and feedback from others it will give 30km/l or max 35km/l even it will move down to 25km/l if your driving is rash(for my driving only 26 - 28 km/l).But its 200cc and most of now a days bikes gives the same. Don't calculate the mileage with reserve to reserve, the reserve don't work at the same point always.Look.5 stars.The look of this bike i don't know how your friends will tell you but i am sure if you maintain clean with all your chrome parts shining as new with proper maintenance when you go out at least two person will ask you about your bike.For this cost this bike will look like miss world with you. Lol. You should not let the dirt stay on your bike for more than 2 weeks its chrome will start with spots of oxides and if its shining is lost it will look like old mummy when you park it along with other bikes.So its important you clean it at-least twice in a month and in rainy seasons at-least once in a week.Maintenance: if your don't maintain your bike clean and with proper service its not your choice of bike.This bike requires a lot of maintenance.Chain and sprocket life 15000 - 20000kms. Speedometer have to be replace at 30000km i don't know whether bajaj have kept some lock to stop its working after 30000kms .If its avenger 200 you have to change the brakes to 220 type braking system else the braking is not good.Clutch cable have life not more than 5000kms. First battery you have to change it within 2- 3 years and the new exide dry battery give me life more than 3.5 years now.The main draw back for this bike is, this bike don't have kicker option but i appreciate bajaj effort since my bike haven't given any trouble in starting till now other than the battery dry up problem.At any time it will start with just one press you can relay on this.I had false neutral in between gear 4th & 5th which i had to fix it in pro biking now its ok. Rear tyre is difficult to find since its not common in other bikes so tyre shops don't keep it in stock.Rear brake will always make noise as lorry brake you can make ""n"" no of maintenance but still it will be the same.This is not the bike for one who clean and service the bike once in a while.If you maintain this bike well with cleaning and proper periodic maintenance and spare parts changed it is the best bike you will never give-up even for harley.",6 years ago,5,5,5,5,5,Daily Commute,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,11,2

Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,5,Bought it after making a wish around 20 years back,"For me buying this bike was like an achievement. The first time it was launched with the name Eliminator by then named Kawasaki-Bajaj, I think I'm the year 1999-2000 I remember this as I was doing my graduation and was shocked to know its price at Rs.90,000/-. This was the costliest bike on the Indian roads manufactured in India. Since then I was a fan of this bike for its length (wheelbase) and the overall road appearance. Finally, I bought this bike in 2019 which almost 20 years from making a wish to finally buying it. The current model is technically quite advanced compared to the first one and Even in looks as well. This bike is a sheer pleasure on the long rides for its aesthetics and the seating posture which gives you superb comfort.

Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,5,My personal god-like experience! 3,"Riding ""feels like god"" for real. It's a delight to ride it with the immense torque it provides and the great stability and control the company has managed to acquaint. The braking is fabulous even though it doesn't have a rear disc brake and even in an emergency braking situation, it's easy to control with skidding tyres too! mine is the cruise 220 model so it obviously has a great, rich and luxurious look with the front windshield (visor) installed. I reached a speed of 130 km/h once and then had to slow down due to fear honestly. Even at high speeds of  >100 km/h, it doesn't feel like you are reaching the limit of the bike. The rider's seat is fabulously comfortable! the rear back-rest is some real comfortable addition. Headlights are really powerful and reliable! servicing at the authorized service stations is a smooth process and there isn't much need of servicing felt even when the time arrives. The battery has performed awesome till now as well. One issue though is the braking sound that starts coming in the rainy season and goes only once you get it fixed during servicing. Also, buying experience was a little troublesome at the showroom; they took more time than they at first had stated. Pros of buying are many and I've already stated most above except another benefit that unlike royal enfields, it doesn't require so much of maintenance and doesn't vibrate excessively. Also it has some useful meters such as the trip-meter and fuel gauge which are both missing even in the latest 2017 royal enfields. Cons are just the rear brake sound, rear drum brakes instead of disc brakes (however that doesn't trouble me) and most importantly, lack of storage space and a safe helmet lock.",7 years ago,4,5,5,5,5,Everything,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,Don't let the tyre specially the rear tyre pass through water deposits on the road a lot. Try your best to prevent it or the rear brake starts making sounds. Don't let your bike stand open in the sunlight for a long time such as 3-4 hours or the shine of the body will gradually vanish and that's something you will really regret later!,5,0

This bike is simply superb that gave me complete pleasure when i ride this, worth buying this with reasonable price tag.Good experience with bajaj people also.2.Riding experience.

Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,4,avenger 220 cruise,"Apart from all the minor problems(like chain noise, and front disc brake noise like zzz which comes when braking at high speed) everything seems perfectly fine. Bajaj offers the best budget bike with all the comfort and power. Not going with all the specifications as internet will know better than me, i just want to say its the best cruiser bike at its range.Avenger 220 cruise is best in class in comfort and power, although avenger having a mid range punch performs much better at 4-5k rpm, i.E, it does not have pick up like pulsar 220f but performs great at 4-5k rpm. Power delivery and gear shifting is smooth in avy 220 but sometimes because of hard gears sometimes the gear gets stuck, but it is all fine when pressed hard. Now about the break in period according to owners manual the engineer's have asked to top 65kmph at 6th gear but i personally have topped the speed of 86kmph, but have gone to this speed only 4 to 5 times, but mainly have kept it below 65kmph. Myth buster here is that during the break in period we should vary the rpm so that the piston rings seals perfectly....Even too much pampering damages the engine performance and mileage. The trick is to vary the rpm slowly and not at one go. Even at 86 kmph the vibrations were minimum compared to other bikes, but there were one or two times when the vibration really used to shake me up. Avenger has really worked with the seats this time where the pillion seat have been cushioned and riders seat is as good as before. City riding is great as on a daily basis i travel 40km without a pain in any part of my body. About the cornering- its not the best bike for cornering but feels pretty confident while cornering, and it has the best in class manoeuvrability compared to other cruisers in its class although it has a huge turning radius but is really easy to turn. It was a matter of time to get used to this bike after that it was the best bike a company could offer. Before avenger 220 cruise i really used to hate cruisers, but now this is not the case. Few things i really hate is that bajaj has not offered back disc brake and abs in bike which packs 19bhp. One more thing is that bajaj should have offered tachometer in bike as without it break in period is really difficult as you don't get a rough idea about your engine condition, even tuning the idle screw is a problem. One more thing which disappoints me the most is faulty fuel indicator, because of which refuelling becomes a big problem even calculating mileage becomes problematic. Apart from it riding is a lot fun at mid range a lot of power is felt in your hand but at high rpm's it doesn't feel quite well as punchiness is lost to it( but cant be sure about this because haven't tried this more than once...So it might happen that after first service things might open a bit.Overall riding this bike has been fun its a perfect bike for a family person and a person who travels a lot. Its basically of cruising at speed of 80- 100 kmph without any vibrations or problems like other sub 200cc bikes. I say if you are a person who likes to enjoy the scenario with no hurry or adrenaline rush in body this is the perfect bike for you.Although 0-60 kmph at 3rd gear takes roughly 4.2 seconds and according to some owners the bike can go upto 140kmph if well maintained. Therefore to conclude its the best bike in this price range with minimal service cost and maintenance cost. Although chain and brake noise bothers me a lot, not to mention its drum brakes, but every other thing about this bike is just so awesome.",6 years ago,5,3,4,4,5,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,3-6 months,Keep it stock for best performance.,4,0

I got co-operative support from sales team to get moon white colour available for me.Riding experience : comfort of bike for a rider is up to the mark as the back gets the perfect rest due to sitting position is the only reason i took this cruiser no matter how hectic traffic you follow. Joyful long drives & love of bike in heart. No back pains even on bumpy roads the plus point of this bike for any ride you go. Definitely deserves the title ""feel like god""Performance : simply excellent if you don't mess & ride it genuinely, like people complaint about mileage. If you throttle it full & speed up even above its limit then mileage will say you sorry. I basically ride under 40 to 60kph its gives me about 43kpl after first service. Exhaust is mind blowing.. People complaint on knocking of engine on its gears i basically observed if you drive on top gear & your speeding on 25kmph so it will definitely don't makes any sense. Looks : black is love white is an emotions.... The grey colour graphics detailing & fading of graphic on white perfectly suits & indeed for a designer :) .... Attractive dlr's is the reason makes me buy this too... I face the problem on road people ask in how much bucks you took whats the mileage etc etc.. Haha.. Service & maintenance : economical if you compare to mopeds.. Its my first bike version so lets see. You cant expect harley davidson in this price....

Because of its foot stand's position you can really feel the comfort while riding at the same time if you want the speed then 220 cc engine will capable of given your desired speed with no or very less jerking.Stylish head light (led)which is on with ignition will attract others at the same time opposite direction vehicles also can  noticed you from long distance in day light also unlike other bikes. Mileage wise also you can get around 40 kmpl which is ok with 220 cc.Another important point it also gives comfort to pillion rider also by providing back support.Only cons is self starting problems with some bike which can be overcome easily by visiting nearby service centre (if you have self start problem better to visit service centre n get it solved as some of these model is having this problem which i think it's may be any manufacturing defects with some of these bikes not all the bikes.

Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,1,Don't buy this bike in this generation. You have better technology with other bike,"I had an avenger 180cc 2006 model. Last year I bought avenger 220 cruises because 180 had a good run. 220 cruise bike is still an old technology bike with single-channel abs. I'm a 6ft guy and my daily commute is 45-50 km and my occasional rides like 200-300km long. This bike chain sprocket is replaced within 10 months at 3200rs cost at bajaj service center.  The service center is also expensive. Free service was also costing around 2000rs. The break pads changed twice. Too much engine vibration. You can literally feel your leg shaking. After 1 year above 80km the bike becomes a vibrator. Suspension is not that great. Also, it's a tubed tyre so if it is punctured by a nail and dragged for a while you will have to change the tube. That’s expensive as hell. 400-500rs for tube and outer tyre patchwork. The fuel indicator is so bad it displays low when you still have 5-6 ltr of petrol. Bajaj, I think it's time to upgrade the technology or close this bike production. I regret that I bought it.",1 year ago,4,2,2,1,2,Daily Commute,10000-15000 kms,5000-15000 kms,> 1 yr,Don't buy this bike because maintenance from the service center and parts are expensive.,11,8
Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,5,My family member,"I bought an avenger 200cc about 15 years ago and my buying experience was amazing.  Initially I did a test drive of 180cc vehicle however when I decided to buy that time Bajaj stopped manufacturing 180cc instead started selling 200cc oil cooled engine bike.  Have decided to go ahead and got the vehicle and I never regret for my decision and its part of my family for the last 1.5 decades.Before buying this vehicle I was owning a 150cc bike from a different brand and I used to drive that vehicle 50Kms everyday as round trip to my office.  Have suffered with sever back pain and switched to Avenger 200cc towards the end of 2007.  The riding experience of this vehicle is amazing and very comfortable and Infact you can go 500km in on stretch without any hiccups.  It give such a wonderful driving comfort.This cruiser Vehicle looks very attractive especially with that big windshield glass. During 2007-2011 time, I was the only one who had this vehicle and everyone will have a look at my vehicle when I drive on the road and that was an amazing feeling and happy moments.  I have done more 60K KMs with (meter got reset once due to some problem and hence don't have the exact number).  Its giving a mileage of 40km/liter on Highway and around 30Km/liter on local city drives. initially I was finding it a bit difficult for getting this vehicle serviced as that time probiking service centre was not available at my hometown. I used to take the vehicle to near by city (by driving around 40km from my place) for service. Within couple of years they have opened service centre in my town itself.Pros: 1.Seating comfort and driving ergonomics2. Very steady on the road especially on wet driving conditions.3. Petrol tank capacity is decent4. Amazing look and very good engine and decent mileageCons:Actually I don't have any cons to write.  However, if you are of more than 6ft height then you may feel slightly uncomfortable during your rite due to  the height of the vehicle.",2 years ago,5,5,5,5,5,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,Get your vehicle serviced once in six months rest it will take care of you,6,3

The way it catches 0 to 60 is amazing. In looks it's more catchy and sexier than the previous variant. The servicing is not so costly but worth a 220 cc bike.

Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,5,Avengers - feels like godfather of all bikes.,"Hello friends sorry for long review but please make space and feel free to check this. My dad used to ride the most comfortable scooter bajaj chetak,we feel like anything. We as family rides on it from dads office town to our home town almost 50kms he upgraded chetak thrice. Everybody knows how much we connected to that legendary scooter. And now i owned avenger cruise, brought it on december 10 2015 almost 2 and half years and 35k kms of awesome riding experience. Seriously i spent more than 6 months on internet for reviews of all bikes and went to friends who own one to take a test ride. And at last i narrowed to go with cruisers as i use to travel more than 100k a day to my office and for long drive purpose too.  So i need a comfortable ride even after a hard day at work sitting in chairs more than 7 hours a day. So i took every chance to take test drives and collecting of feed backs of customers from direct and social media. I am at the end of the road with two bike choices in hand royal enfield thunder bird and bajaj avenger. When i came across with all checks pros and cons of the bikes my first concern is availability as per the dealer it will took 5 to 6 months at least to get an enfield that means you can't get your bike right away even if you pay in full. Everyone knows how auto engineering evolves very rapid these days you book a bike of the day but getting  6 months outdated bike in hand later. Maintenance is my second factor and last one is price. With my data in hand and past experiences with bajaj i choose avenger to thunder bird.  When i am about to book my ride i came to know that they are launching new models in the segment so i waited 3 more months to get the bikes launched and went to a dealer with my dad having cruise model in mind. My dad rode both street 220 and cruise and liked cruise. So i paid in full, with in 2 hours they delivered my bike i am there with my bike while they are fitting. Rode back to our home town and started to wrooom. Feel like i got the ride of my life. Just sitting on the seat makes you comfortable and cruising makes your ride more comfortable. I choose comfortable to looks but this one won't let you down in looks,seriously even after two and half years of launching these machines, every other biker will turn their heads to check this bike and thinks that this must be very expensive bike. Build quality is good maintenance is pocket friendly as we can say virtually zero. I took all care and love to keep my avenger fit. I use power petrol or premium petrol earlier and now using essar only and filled up tires with nitrogen gas, will change engine oil for every 2k kms and will lubricate chain when needed so i am getting 45kmpl. I didn't find any fault in bike even after 35k in two and half years of cruising. I am waiting for upgrade of avenger (not cosmetic upgrades though) and sure will upgrade with one. I didn't find any difficulty in service and maintaining this bike. Dealers are good and help you to get your bike repaired an delivered in time. Spares also very easy to get no need to wait for long and some kind of affordable too.At this price tag you can't get more comfortable ride than this.Pros: comfort riding,pocket friendly maintenance, bike will responds to you very fast. Cons: nothing much to complain but yes needs some real upgraded machine now. If possible company customisation is preferable. Thanks guys for spending your valuable time to check this. If you are considering to buy a bike then i suggest you to take test ride of avengers and i am sure you won't get disappointed and also sure that you will book one right away.

Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,4,A beast when it comes to power performance and looks,"1. I had bought the avenger cruise 220 in the year 2016 from the bajaj motor dealership dewan motors in tilak nagar,new delhi. My experience of buying was really an amazing one. I had always wished to buy a touring and a good cruiser bikes and this one is for sure an awesome machine. My experience with the dealership was also very good. The kind for service and the information provided was well explanatory.2. My riding experience with the bike is really very good even till now. The power which the bike provides is really good, even though you won't expect that much from a cruiser. The top speed that i have achieved was of 110 km per hour which was very well balanced. The feel of the motorcycle is the one major thing which sets it apart from all other bikes. Even the vibrations could be felt after crossing that 100 mark although that may sound a bit illogical as it's not a sports bike so you can't expect such a thing. The acceleration is quite good and easy to control, the brakes are find especially when both the brand used together, the tyres are also of a very good quality as sometimes they even allow you to battle off roads easily.3. Talking about the looks and performance, the look of the bike is ready amazing. It's a beautiful machine. Especially that long windshield on the front adds to its beauty and style. It makes you shine in front of other people as the dashing look forces them to turn their heads. The chrome linings at the side and the avenger written at the support of back seat and the handle bar is another aspect of its beauty.Even the disc brake in the front wheel looks great. 4. The service is done once every  9-12 months. Although it is not necessary. The maintenance of the vehicle is comparatively economical and easy as compared to other bikes of the same category. The machine does not create much of problems and is very well built. The auto parts are all very good in quality and performance. One thing of concern is the battery used by the company as it is not a long lasting one and has to me heated in order to start. Overall the functioning is good.5. Talking about the pros the machine is a beast when it comes to power, performance and looks. The feel which it provides to a rider is just ineffable. It is especially worth for the ones looking for a daily ride as well as a touring machine. Talking about the cons the company could have provided the bike with a kick start option as well as the battery is not efficient enough to generate power only through the self start. It may create problems during rainy season and the bike takes time to start.

Wear & tear, rust, exposure to water, sun and too cold, every weather has some impact on parts and performance. So after 10 years of riding it I started facing some issues of engine sound, loosening of fasteners, vibrations etc. But maintenance is very economical. You can go for it if your budget is not high and want to cruise only. However, for rash driving go for some rough or sporty bike.",9 weeks ago,5,5,5,4,4,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,Go for tubeless tyres.,5,3
Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,5,Experience of over a decade with my avenger,"1) my buying experience was horrible as it was my first bike and i choose a dealer instead of the showroom.Which got my bike delayed by 2weeks.But when it arrived, there was no end to my happiness. 2) riding experience: i have had my bike for more than a decade and have rode my bike to most of the states and cities around india. It one the most comfortable bike for long rides.Here are a few destinations i rode too: mum-goa, mum-aurangabad, mum-gujrat-ajmer-gurgoan-delhi-nazamabad-mandi-bajaura-manali-kasol-choj-mum, mum-mahableshwar, mum-lonavala etc. It has been my favorite companion over the years, no matter if i was riding solo - with a pillion or with a group.It always has been wonderful riding my devil. 3) when you look at it, it doesn't looks anything less than a mini harley. Riding the bike anywhere is amazing, whether it's slushy roads towards rajmachi during rains, bike will never say it can't go beyond a certain path. Throw anything at it and you will be surprised how well it performs and make you reach your destination. I clearly remember my ride to rajmachi, there was a patch where even bullets were stucked but my avenger crossed the patch with minimum trouble. Its amazing on the ghats and would just on the road. 4) service cost is very low for an avenger.High grade oil for best performance cost rs. 1000 max Bike was and oil lube Rs. 300 max Total service cost 1500 max. Its very easy to maintain the bike for a longtime without hurting your pocket. 5) pros: amazing ride quality, great comfort for rider and pillion, good tyres, good brakes. Cons: front disc gets lock if applied suddenly and can result in a fall.

However, it falls short in terms of service and customer care, with a lack of support from the manufacturer.The bike's engine is its strongest point, providing smooth power delivery and decent performance. The comfortable ride quality makes it suitable for long rides, and the fuel efficiency is impressive.However, the lack of a kick-start option and poor battery reliability are significant drawbacks. When the battery dies, you're left with no option but to push the bike, which can be frustrating.Additionally, the service and customer care provided by Bajaj are disappointing, with long waiting times and unhelpful staff.*Verdict:*The Bajaj Avenger 220 Cruise is a good bike, but its flaws hold it back from being a great one.

Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,4,Best budget cruiser. Unreal performance without a huge dent on your budget.,"I purchased my bike in 2017 when the avenger cruise was first launched. It was the perfect design for the avenger although I feel they downgraded the classic look by trying to make it ""stylish"" after that year. Still, a very beautiful bike and a very unique design compared to the same ghisa-pita designs of res, jawas, h'ness etc. Avenger brings novelty to the bike design in that aspect.Coming to the riding experience. This is the single most comfortable bike I've ever sat on and the first thing I've noticed that always pops out of the pillion rider's mouth when they sit is, ""wow. The backseat is so comfortable"", as the backrest for the pillion enhances the experience. There is a point to be noted here. The pillion seat is only comfortable for short commutes. For long rides, it's extremely uncomfortable. The seat for them is very narrow and can cause uncomfortable pains as the ride goes on. The rider seat on the other hand is perfection. I've done a roughly 450 km ride in one sitting with no fatigue or strain by the end of it. The ride was super comfortable.Coming to the performance side of the bike. It's a killer bike with very good performance. Can go up to 120 kmph safely. Anything more and you will most likely be causing harm to your bike. However, an important point to keep in mind. It's a cruiser end of the day and not a sports bike. So at cruising speeds of 70-80 kmph, it's buttery smooth but once you cross maybe 90-95 kmph, you'll start noticing vibrations. The bike will still remain stable even at high speeds but maybe a pair of biker gloves will definitely be needed to reduce the impact of vibrations while riding. It's got very good acceleration and the performance is killer for the price band. Mileage is another great thing on this bike. Gives around 35-40 kmph easily. Official mileage is 45 kmph though.One of the star features of this bike is the cost of maintenance. I've seen a few people say maintenance costs them 2500-3500 each visit which surprises me. I only get the bike services at bajaj service centers and it usually costs around 1500. In fact, it has never crossed 2000. Prices of spare parts are dirt cheap. I had a terrible accident once which left heavy damage on one side of the bike but I managed to come out of the service center with a bill only amounting to around 4k by the end of it. The only problem is the quality of service. A lot of bajaj service centres keep ruining the experiences for customers with sub-par services. So what I do now is I check the ratings of service centres in my city and pick the highest-rated ones only. That's one benefit of bajaj service centres. You'll be spoilt for choice. There are usually multiple service centers in a single city. I've had a great experience at such high-rated service centres. Some people say this bike is difficult to ride in cities. I say that's nonsense. I've been using it in cities and in fact, I regularly go crisscrossing in traffic and I have never faced an issue with this bike. It all comes down to practice and your riding abilities. The turning radius is higher and the bike is longer than most other standard bikes. So trying to make tight corners will be a challenge but I easily maneuver through city traffic with no problem. It's just an over-exaggerated problem in my opinion.An underrated feature on this bike is its windshield. It's a killer windshield that pushes the wind up in such a great way that I've seen many random things that flew toward the bike usually get redirected immediately due to the flow of the wind over the screen. Plus it gives a very classic look to the bike.",1 year ago,5,5,5,4,5,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,"Keep servicing it regularly. Make sure it's a well-oiled machine.

I did full r&d of various bikes, found recently updated avenger performance, then picked that too special color of golden version.2. Classic, cool and sportive, best on road at any instances, no complaint if serviced on time , don't rely on engine drain time, though it can run 5k monitor service interval, every 500/2000 check chain lube,  air filter and basic cleaning, since more dust also affects mechanic of suspension as well the ride.3.

I still ride 130+ with smooth acceleration. This is a carburettor type, so slowly raise will swing the bike in light speed.Perfect road balance, good aerodynamic, i met few sudden break situation, the bike is still in control, never slipped out of hand or never thrown pressure over.

Cons- it's difficult to find air filling station, since many station have lengthy rod connected with their nozzle, doesn't fit rear wheel to fill the air.

In peak summer do service within 3000km if you love the engine to live long or keep monitoring on engine oil level as well find enough shade to cool down, since its air cooled radiator type. No coolant oil is circulated.

Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,5,Its a good motorcycle,"Buying experience was good. I use this bike for both city and highway rides. Went for a 2500 km tour. It easily covered 450 km per day at 75kmph with pillion and fully loaded side boxes. I had to modify the pillion seat as it was not at all comfortable for even a short ride. The mileage it gave us was about 44kmpl. In city it gives about 40 km/l. Service center people are good. Maintenance costs are very less. May be I need to wait for some more time to comment on the maintenance part. But as of now I did not find any issue with the bike or servicing. Pros: Everything is good, Good mileage, low service costs.

Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,3,My review on avenger 220 cruise,"1. Riding experience - it's a good bike to cruise on the highways. But for the daily commute, it's very difficult to handle and maintenance also increases.2. Look wise it is very good and the performance of the bike could be better, again it is very difficult to shift gears within the city traffic but for highways it's fine. I had to bore the engine after 52000 kms and when asked in the showroom they said this is common in all the bajaj bikes. But I was not able to understand even after so good maintenance and all periodic services done on time, the engine boring to be done.3. Riding experience- I have had this bike since Apr 2017 and I have completed 84000 kms. I have hit upto 135kms/hour in this bike and still it can be controlled when you are so used to it, but braking could be better, we need to struggle a bit by shifting the gears along with the brakes to control the bike when needed to stop it.4. Maintenance- the spares for this bike is a little costly when compared to the other bikes in the same range, yes that is because they have used only heavy materials for this bike when compared with pulsar. If used more within the city then the maintenance will increase more.5. Personal opinion - if you have a spare bike to commute to the city then you can go for this, else all your days will be very tough. This is a very good bike for cruising on highways. I have achieved 1680kms in a day riding it for about 18 hours continuously. You need to spend at least 3k to maintain this bike every 2-2.5 months. I didn't face any big problems with this bike since I didn't care about spending it. I used it mostly for highways and occasionally within the city.",1 year ago,4,4,5,2,3,Everything,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,7,7
Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,4,Good and bad of avenger 220 cruise,"Sales team is friendly no comments on them. No comments on the comfort (cruse 220) of the bike for the rider, but for the back seat it should have been much bigger, the chain makes hell lot of noise and dries up for every 250kms. Showroom service sucks. 3 times i took for the same chain issue they just oil dip the chain. It would have been better if there was a chain guard at the bottom so that the chain wouldn't get dried up. The gear automatically shifts from 4th gear to 3rd gear, spoke about this issue in service centre they said because of the chain getting dried up. After riding just for 15kms if the bike gets off than should wait at least for 20 mins to restart the bike (no solution from service team). Started get burning smell from the air cool part after the service was done (no solution from service team again).",6 years ago,5,3,4,2,4,Daily Commute,5000-10000 kms,5000-15000 kms,6 months-1 yr,You like or not chain spray for every 250kms and get the chain adjusted after 500kms.,4,4

Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220,4,A feast to biking experience,"First of all, i would like to thank bajaj for coming up with such a marvellous piece. The bike is just awesome whether you consider riding experience, ride quality, engine performance, servicing & maintenance costs, looks, and anything else about any bike.I have been riding this bike since april 2018 and i must say that my experience riding the bike has been just brilliant. This was my first ever bike that i have bought, and i had no previous experience of riding bikes. I was sceptical at first whether to go for it or not because, firstly, it was a cruiser secondly, because of its length and thus manoeuvrability was a big question for me having no prior experience to ride a bike and thirdly, because of my short height (5' 4""). But i must say that avenger 220 cruise has aced in all aspects given the smooth ride experience it provides and it makes you truly 'feel like god (f.L.G.)' period. The riding experience is extremely smooth and you barely feel any vibrations. Handling in city traffic is also very easy and given my short height, i am easily able to handle it even in bumper to bumper traffic. I mainly use it for office commute and it takes me anywhere between 60-90 minutes to cover a distance of 12 kms one side. Thus you can understand the bad traffic in which i ride it.Looks & performance. The looks of the bike is just awesome especially moon white version. It catches eyes of so many people walking on the streets. But the best part is when fellow bikers also take a glare at my bike when i am waiting in the traffic. It just makes me feel so proud as an owner. Also, the look and feel of the bike gives you a premium feel when you ride the bike. All the parts and accessories are of high quality.Performance wise, the bike does its job of a 220cc engine. It does not stall or vibrates even at a speed of around 100 kmph. The best part is its smooth handling at high speeds. However, do not expect it to run smoothly at 100+ kmph speeds as this is a cruiser and not a sport/racing bike.Servicing & maintenance. Coming from bajaj family, the servicing and maintenance costs are really low and not a pocket burner. I have just completed my scheduled 2nd servicing and it just costed me around rs. 400 which is very minimal. Maintaining the bike is also very cost effective just using good quality engine oils, chain lubes and other regular stuff should do the job.Service experience at one of the bajaj service centres has not been very good though, but that issue got resolved when for the 2nd service i took it to the other service center. Pros:1. Great looks and premium feel 2. Very good riding posture and comfortable for long rides (did to and fro from bangalore to mysore in single day without any discomfort and back pain)3. Riding experience and performance is excellent. Cons:1. Little bit of heating issue while riding in traffic. 2. Pillion seat is not so comfortable as due to very little width. Overall, i would say, this is a great bike for both beginners and experienced riders. Don't think twice, if you are planning to buy it. Just go for it, you won't regret your decision!!",5 years ago,4,4,5,3,5,Daily Commute,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,6 months-1 yr,No Tips,0,0

Bajaj Avenger Street 220,3,Good in the Past but outdated now.,"I Sold my Royal Enfiled Thunderbird 500 after riding it for 4 years and wanted to buy a cruiser.  I found out that 500 cc was overpowering and I did not require such a heavy machine. in 2017, there were not many cruisers out there. I opted for Avenger Street 220. Purchased it second-hand as it was fairly new, only 1500 km ridden. The First time I sat on this bike, it was so light and had no vibrations at all (compared to RE). Now I am writing this review after 42000 Kilometers and 6 years.Pros:1. The bike is a cruiser and while you are riding it you feel like sitting on the sofa.2. An average of 40 km is good.3. Reliable machine. I service the bike myself and never took it to a mechanic in these 6 years for servicing. I only went to the mechanic once or two times because of the clutch plate, tire change, etc.4. Looks are subjective but I feel it looks different and people do look back towards it.Cons:1. Longer wheelbase: The problem with a longer wheelbase is that it takes time to adjust to it.  A larger turning radius is one of the drawbacks of it.2. Brakes are not great: The front disc is below average and the rear is drum break, which I feel is not good.3. Confidence in high speed: I am not confident of taking this bike over 80. On only highways, I would like a machine that could cruise at 80-90 easily. You can't do that with it.4. Falls: I have fallen from this bike a lot of times, thanks to the longer wheelbase, brakes, and MRF tires. This bike has a big learning curve. My final verdict is that this bike was a good few years back but at this moment we have many more options in the Cruiser segment. Also, the Bajaj has not updated the bike with the required features of the present.If you ask me, I would avoid buying it now.",35 weeks ago,3,3,5,4,4,Tours,> 15000 kms,15000+ kms,> 1 yr,No Tips,7,4

Bajaj Avenger Street 220,5,Honest review on Bajaj Avenger 220 Street(not cruise) as a college student and casual rider,"All the processes around purchase were really smooth and quick. Received it the same day.I use it as a daily commuter for college and other daily stuff.Super comfortable. A little bit on the heavy side if you don't work out on your physical strength.For a cruiser, It has amazing pickup and speed compared to other cruisers in the similar segment and can actually compete with higher cc ones like Meteor, cb.Looks have stayed loyal to the original Bajaj Avenger except for some the new curves and better headlights. Compared to other cruisers barely any engine vibrations.First service was really smooth.Pros-much easier to maintain than other cruisers.Amazing comfort and ride quality.Pocket-friendly when it comes to maintenance and service expenses.Can easily provide mileage as good as the company guarantees if driven properly without unnecessary braking and constant or sudden heavy throttles. Can easily pick sixty kmph speed under six seconds(personal experience) and can reach a hundred kmph on  third gear. One-twenty-five kmph is its max speed without red line(not suggested red lining it within first few months)Cons- Doesn't have dual disc brake or dual channel ABS(single channel ABS only)Terrible turning radius due to making it difficult for packed cities.Uncomfortable seat for pillion.(Would suggest changing its seat)Lacks LED Headlights and indicators.Ground clearance is really bad as it is more on the low-rider side.(Amazing for short people like me- im five'five)No reviewer,TPMS, Bluetooth connectivity or charging port is available.Superstock bike, not for someone looking for a bike with a lot of techs tho i hope they provide new tech with their upcoming Avenger 400.",19 weeks ago,5,4,5,4,5,Everything,< 5000 kms,0-5000 kms,6 months-1 yr,Dont overrev and lubricate its chain and other moving parts once a month atleast.,1,0
