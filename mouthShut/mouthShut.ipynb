      "This bike “Byk” was designed for comman man keeping in mind about the mileage, but they forgot about all the other major things which make this bike ineligible in aspects of appearance as well as specifications. even though it has a 100 cubic capacity engine ( 92.2 to be exact) this byk does not even run uproads. while you are with the pillion rider the engine sounds as if you have a bunch of people seated together and the engine is struggling to make the bike move.\n",
      "Think if you get a bad quality after paying a lots of money to buy any byk and after buying a big part of your earning is going  for the maintenance of that byk and with the poor average quality your days will gonna be stressful . so here is the solution for your query and that is bajaj byk with best average and reliable as far as you go with it . you can easily handle bajaj byk and its always will be in your control and sure with its wow looks you can impress  anyone and finally your life will be go smooth and peaceful .\n",
      "If talk as a look, really wonder full. Stylish byke. This is one of the best byke I have used. It is really a nice byke. If any one is going to purchase byke there is no one byke which is as good as bajaj. A person if ones use bajaj byke he can never thought to purchase any other byke expet bajaj. In bajaj all bykes are superb but pulsur is the best in my eyes. Even in my family there is only bajaj bykes. No one in my family want to use any other byke except babaj. Bajaj I love this barnd and I suggest to every one to purchase only bajaj because it is the best in all.\n",
      "Hi Friends, I would like to share my genuine feeling about the Bajaj Bike because I have brought this bike for my shop purpose to deliver the goods to the customers. This bike mileage is ok not so good it is giving 60 kms per liter and comfort for this is not so good if we travel long than definitely will need to suffer from back pain.\n",
      "As we all know about the Bajaj brand is good and available genuine parts in the market but for this there is no genuine in parts we need to suffer for the parts in the market the is no availability  and about engine is very lite we need to check there is engine or not like wise. For bike brakes it’s not so good we need to wait for 3 to 5 seconds. In cities we need to suffer a lot to travel in this bike. I don’t want give suggestion to bring this bike to anyone.\n",
      "Thank You\n",
      "It's average fuel mileage is about 65kmpl, No it's not comfortable it Vibrates all the time, The seat quality is very hard poor, The comfort on this is very poor, No it's not reliable, It's engine doesn't feel it is there, You need to give a lot of effort while changing gears, It's tires also vibrate because of the engine, Handling is really poor, It's isn't good in city's, it's braking is like a cycle I would say, The bike causes a lot of discomfort, Looks are very poor,\n",
      "Hope it was helpful\n",
      "Thank you\n",
      "Bajaj company konws for their sports bikes like pullsor 220 , 180 these bikes are reliable and comfortable but these bike need high maintanance. If I talk about look then these bikes are awesom in look and pick up of these bikes are very good . Only one thing is bad in these bikes is customers have to spend huge money on it maintainance.\n",
      "If you are going to buy a bike of Bajaj make, please listen me first. I am not your enemy . Please share my experience, that in after Sales Services Bajaj is India’s mot WORST and GHATIYA company. I had Purchased one BYK bike of this company.\n",
      "And till date I am suffering Because of non availability of spare parts at companies show room. And After investment of near about half lacs once again I am on bicycle.\n",
      "Now what you are thinking please runaway from Bajaj showrooms.\n",
      "HI all,\n",
      "I have faced the same issue buying the same BYK. I am suffering like anything because there is no availability of spares.When I visited some showrooms they are redirecting to some places where the spares are not available at all.They even redirected me to SHIVAJINAGAR GUJARI WHICH I FELT VERY BAD FOR PURCHASING BAJAJ BYK. I NEVER RECOMMEND ANYBODY TO BUY THIS BIKE.\n",
      "I THOUGHT BAJAJ IS THE GOOD COMPANY TO BUY BIKES, BUT AFTER BUYING THIS BIKE I HAVE NOT BOUGHT ANY BIKE BECAUSE OF THE IMPRESSION I GOT FROM BAJAJ.\n",
      "RAKESH.U\n",
      "I have purchased many bikes of Bajaj Automobiles i.e. Bajaj Caliber, Bajaj Boxer then Bajaj BYK. After 2 months its machine got damaged. Then after facing of lac problems, company changed the machine. but that machine also damaged in 3 months. I faced many problem in this bike like average, balance, electrical problems etc. I thank that was my wrong decision and company make that model discontinue that days. I requesed to company for change my model with another one. But they gave me only verbal commitment. After lac of problem I decided to sold it. Then I sold that BYK in 10% amount........ Thats why nowadays I never buy the new launch of bikes and  I said never buy the BYK because its full mean is Buy Yourself to Kill (BYK)......... Pradeep Sood 231 A Narsingh Marg, Brahmpuri Road, Jaipur 302001 Mobile 92148-76650 (Beware this Product and tell to friends)\n",
      "Hi all,\n",
      "I bought this bike when recommended by on of my friend. I am using this Bajaj BYK more than 3 years. No problem except few minor. I gives a good milage ranging from 80-85 on road. The vehicle is good to ride in the city for its milage and the light weight.\n",
      "One issue has to be addressed here in the vehicle is that the vibration and the balance part especially when try to ride the vehicle at the speed of 65+.\n",
      "It is recommended to increase the wheel base of the vehicle for better worthiness.\n",
      "the vehicle has the good tank capacity and also sufficient reserve capacity to run till a safer distance even during the long journey.\n",
      "This vehicle is quiet ok for the people who require good milage and better riding comfort. The cost of the vehicle is as well less when compared to the other brand vehicles in the range of 90-110cc.\n",
      "Narasimhan\n",
      "Bajaj BYK is a perfect Value For Money bike. It is a 100% Paisa Vasool vehicle and is a true traffic cutter. Priced at under Rs.30000, this bike is ideal for people who are looking for economy, zero maintainence, trendy looks and super comfort.\n",
      "With a 92.1cc engine, the bike easily steers from 0-60 Kms/hr in less than 10 seconds. Especially on the third gear, give a full raise and the bike accelarates like magic. I am quite satisfied with the bike's pickup.\n",
      "The average mileage under city conditions is around 70-80 whereas on highways might reach upto 90. Atleast I haven't heard of any other bike giving such a huge mileage. The TVS Centra and Honda CD Dawn are far behind as far as mileage is concerned.\n",
      "I have read some reviews of other members on this bike where they have complained that the bike gives an average mileage of around 60-75 only. All I can advice them is to get their bikes tweaked.\n",
      "It is a zero maintainence bike. I own this bike for over three years. I ride this bike like crazy but haven't had any complains so far. A normal servicing every six months with oil change can keep the bike in good shape.\n",
      "Who said that it isn't a long distance bike. The distance between my home and office is around 65 Kms and I am riding it daily to office since past three years without a problem. Also I have travelled on this bike for long distances of around 200 kms continously and faced no issues at all. This bike is a darling and the overall cost of travelling on it is cheaper than travelling in public transport.\n",
      "As far as the looks are concerned, the bike might not look very attractive in the showroom when you go to buy it, but when you take it to your local radium shop and get the makeover done, believe me the bike would become a show stopper. I have got my black coloured BYK fully covered with red and blue radium which makes it look like a sports bike. The sleek design of the bike makes it appear trendy and stylish. Now my bike is the cause of envy to all my peers.\n",
      "On highways the Bajaj BYK is probably the slowest. Not only is speed the limiting factor, but since the kerb weight is only 98 Kgs, the bike becomes unstable at 70 Kms/hr or above. So, as strong current of wind blow past the rider there is a certain amount of fear of losing road grip.\n",
      "However if you want a bike for utility purpose and not just for racing, BYK is the ideal choice. I never ride above 70 Kms/hr and discourage other riders from speeding as well. Life is precious. The main idea is to reach your destination safely in time and I think 70 Kms/hr is enough for achieving that. Riding experience should always be more of pleasure than thrill. BYK is a very safe to ride bike. Its braking system is excellent and has been ranked 4/5 by India Bikes. Even if are at 70 Kms/hr and your breaks fail and car suddenly cuts your way, do not panic. Just put both your feet on the ground and you are in immediate control of the bike. There is no way anything would go wrong. Has anyone heard of BYK accidents????\n",
      "BYK is very comfortable to ride. It is as easy to handle as a toy. For ex-RX 100 riders like me, the BYK is a welcome treat since it is lighter than RX100. You'll have no complains of backaches whatsoever. The bike is extremely easy to manuever. You can cut through heavy traffic easily. With its sleek design, the bike can easily get through narrow spaces. The suspension of the BYK is well designed and the shock absorbers good enough to ensure a smooth ride even on bumpy roads. I have tried BYK for off riding experience too and it outperformed my expectations, though at times I felt the need to have that extra power while encountering uphills and on sand. Also the lightweight ensures that you don't have to sweat too much in case the wheels get stuck in a puddle. You can just lift the BYK and get it back on road.\n",
      "Overall I can say that the Bajaj BYK is one of the very few products I am happy buying. It has been a complete satisfying experience. I was one of the earliest buyers of this bike, i.e in December 2002 and I had spent around Rs. 33155 for it. With over 1 Lac Kms travelled in past 3 years, I feel that every single penny I paid  for that bike has been extracted well. Moreover the the bike is still going strong. Even today when I ride it, I feel as if it was a brand new bike. With all the jazzy radium surrounding radium around, the bike still looks like it was just out of showroom. Looks like this bike would serve me well for 10 more years.\n",
      "Thanks Bajaj for creating this masterpiece. Unfortunately the production has stopped due to poor sales. That's primarily people prefer to go for a 150cc Pulsar which doesn't even give a mileage of 55. It is all an individual's choice but when it comes to cost, fuel efficiency, maintainence, safety, appearence, maneuverablity and comfort, nobody can beet the BYK.\n",
      "Why Mr. Bajaj I ask unto thee?why?whats up?A wasted effort I say.it just doesnt fit into the bajaj stable.can it stand shoulder to shoulder with the Pulsars and the Boxers.\n",
      "what a phenomenon these bikes were.\n",
      "no doubt bajaj built this bike with some vision.it has been built to a price and it shows all over the bike(bike?).\n",
      "to begin with the tyres are just too skinny(mileage reasons of course).traction is a nightmare on wet surfaces.component quality is sad.and the little said about the gearbox the better.\n",
      "looks wise it looks too tinny and tiny.\n",
      "biking enthusiasts don't even think abt touching it.handling is harsh and can be frustrating at times.the heart lacks power.seems as if it has been compromised for the mileage part.\n",
      "and to end it all the name byk is so ironical since does'nt even look like one.\n",
      "i would recommend this bike to a guy who loves cycling but hates to pedal.\n",
      "sorry guys but u can surely build better machines.\n",
      "SOME ONE GOT A BICYCLE?\n",
      "Once, my cousin who was about ten years old went to a bicycle shop to buy one.  What came to his site was the Bajaj BYK of the owner and he had been crying ever since then saying that ''I want that bicycle''.\n",
      "As this bike is the smallest of all times, there is no doubt that it can be compared to a moped, but this incident made me compare it to some Hercules cycles.\n",
      "The worst problem is that you should put a board on the front of the bike saying that ''This is not a moped, but a bike'' so that people can respect you and congratulate on getting a new bike!\n",
      "I still wonder how could any one go for a bike like this.  After riding it, I felt that I am sitting on my early ''Streetcat bicycle!  I will always pray to save all from th glimpse of this bike!\n",
      "CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?\n",
      "Look at the bike - it is a small and compact one so that you have some extra space to park it in.  But it is far more ugly than I first thought it is.  Look at the front or back - not all impressive.  The side looks are not bad, but still not worth enjoying!\n",
      "It just seems to be an M80 and made into a bike decreasing the power.  Even those who are looking for small bikes cannot go for this thing as it looks like some one just hit it on the face!\n",
      "Believe me, I will never try to jump onto small, outdated moped-like structure and drive while the road is full of Pulsars!  The only advantage you will have is that it is light and any one can ride it - if it falls on you, not much of a problem!\n",
      "Compare with an Enfield on your legs!  If any one is about to take a license, he can learn bike riding in this bike (don't tell the name of the bike to any one).\n",
      "HELP!  BYK!  ESCAPE\n",
      "The bike which jumps with 92.2cc 4-stroke engine with 6.41bhp@7000rpm has a good factor - you can't drive it too fast - so you are going to live longer!  Long live the bike riders!\n",
      "The vehicle starts to pickup and by the time it manages to reach sixty, we will have reached the destination.  There may not be any smaller bikes to compete with on the Indian roads, but you can adjust with mopeds.\n",
      "Don't look on either sides as everything goes past you - starting from Activa, Dio etc to Pulsar, Fiero and you can spend some time to study all the bikes on road by travelling in BYK.  The bike will give you minimum mileage so that you can watch the other automobiles there and curse the moment that you bought this bike!\n",
      "The comfort may be like sitting on a bull during a bull fight.  From the way in which this thing accelerates, we may think about using both our hands to turn the accelerator!\n",
      "START NAIL BITING\n",
      "Bajaj has its worst model in BYK.  If you are looking for mileage, it is better to go for Centra or CT-100.  Even Boxer impresses more than BYK.  The price was nearly 30,000 for the trouble we put into our head!\n",
      "It is supposed to give 100 km/l?  What about trying to get to 60 first?  This bike is disappearing now.  Thank God!  Just leave the poor bikers alone!  I am glad this one has become a rare scene on roads.\n",
      "Considering the service of Bajaj here, buying this bike would be like putting the head into the mouth of a Dragon!  After riding it, you may wonder which one shivers more - the rider or the bike!\n",
      "I will be happy to recommend any bike ,but not this piece of crap, just like one of my friends told me - ''if this is a bike, I will never even think about buying one''!  What I say is that diving into this bike can cause different problems, but remember - it is easier to push when it has no petrol or gets breakdowns.\n",
      "THANKS FOR READING THE REVIEW.  DO RATE IT AND LEAVE A COMMENT BEHIND BEFORE YOU DIVE OUT OF THE REVIEW\n",
      "Hi guys a person should decide whether to go in for this kind of bike which has no pickup and even the mileage is not up to satiety in the on road condition , it is better to have a vehicle which  is beter than BYK , and under much lesser budger , ie HERO SMART the bike with actual 75kmpl average !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the bike shivers when it is trotting , and has no galloping stage because of its under road handling , byk is an outdated bike and cannot b recommended its better to buy a luna frm KINETIC rather than spending around , its an approach to modify a moped into BYK\n",
      "byk is not atall on the list of recommendation !!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",

      "I have taken Bajaj BYK almost 18 months back, already crossed 25000 kms on my BYK.\n",
      "Eventhough it is said that engine and Byke are only for starters, I never felt while riding it. I ride a lot on Bangalore roads and also go for a long long rides often.\n",
      "I never had any issues in pickup. Engine will take some to get settled up, then wards no issues.\n",
      "It is said that max speed is 80 KMs, I clocked the speed of 110 KMPH on a constant rate, without much vibration ( On a good road) On normal roads vibration will start after 80 - 90 Kmph.\n",
      "Even after 25000, I am getting 75 - 80 kmpl.\n",
      "My overall satisfaction with the bike is Very Good, and Value for Money.\n",
      "I did not visit the dealer much other than scheduled services.\n",
      "Part availabaility with dealers is not good. Due this I am thinking of exchanging my BYK with Bajaj Discover.\n",
      "Well my first criteria to buy bajaj byke was the advertisement mentioning that the byk would go 100 kms. I didn't expect so much as all the advertiser mention a lot bit increased mileage intentionally. I thought if not 100 it could make at least 70. But alas after I purchased and tested and  it was very very dissapointed. It made a mere 54 to 58 kmpl. Its not fair. Advertisements should give a logical or closer declaration.\n",
      "Anyway I am still hopeful that after completiing my running in I will get the actual mileage after final tune up. But I can bet this bike will never ever make 100 k/litre. But apart from this about the byk I have to say in this category; to me its the best looking bike india have produced. The look is absolutely fantastic. The bike is anyway other than the mileage has a comfortable sitting arrangement. Its headlight is real powerful and very helpful at night. . Tyres aren't that impressive but okay for a small byke like this.\n",
      "Hey What is this 100 100??? That was what all the people were thinking when the Ad of BYK first came on the screen.\n",
      "This bike first actually got the people to think can a bike really gine 100 kms.. yes it can an BAJAJ the auto KING of INDIA ...did it..This small bike mostly suited for the people who have to travel a lot to and fro from offices to home and want a mileage bike will go in for this beautiful dream bike. The bike will give a comfortable 90- 100 kms when rode on highway...The problem with this is that it doesnot have the power that is required for the bike freeks who want to travel at speeds of 60 plus... and that too real fast.My recomendation is to people who want to get a milage and can sacrifice the great power..\n",
      "GO 100 GO BYK\n",
      "The bajaj  realisation of having an extremely cheap vehicle has been fulfilled.The psychological sub Rs 30,000 barrier has been broken .The maruti 800 of motorcycles are here and its called as BAJAJ BYK.i have tried this byk and noted the following.\n",
      "1]DESIGN-Low cost does not necessarily mean bad design and byk is plenty proof of that fact.The styling is predominantly angular with too many curves.Covering the smallish 17-inch front tyre is a basic plastic mudguard.The front is dominated by squarish headlamp,though a simple design the fact that its clear lens make it look classy and simple.coming to the handlebar its curiously shaped Very basic switchgear apart from a very easy to use horn button.The instrument looks basic but have some elements of style in them.A few telltail lights a 120 kph Speedometer and a triangular theme.The byk is not a completely new product its derived from M-80 only the difference is that tank now sits above the engine rather than under the seat.\n",
      "RATING:7/10\n",
      "2]ENGINE&PERFORMANCE-The engine is a single cylinder four stroke aircooled unit [92cc],mounted horizontally and good for about 6.5bhp at 7000 rpm.The short gearing is necessary to extract every bit of power from small engine.Constant changing up at ideal revs should get at 85kph mark quickly enough.\n",
      "RATING:7/10\n",
      "3]RIDE&HANDLING-Though the byk does not end up looking like the M-80 it does ride better than stepthrough but not as well as motorcycle.Directional stability is not its forte and fast and overtaking big vehicles causes quite a stir,however byk handles more like a bicycle its risky at turns.The narrow width of the tyres adds all important\n",
      "fuel economy figure.\n",
      "RATING:5/10\n",
      "4]FUEL ECONOMY-The 92cc unit is a perfect balance of pep and economy and figures of almost 80kpl can be achieved.changing gears quickly can get good figures.A 10 litre tank would translate to almost 800 km range.\n",
      "RATING:9/10\n",
      "Pricing the byk at Rs30,000 has won half of the battle,moreover its got the stylistic appeal that most youngsters crave,its got the fault only in areas  such as handling but its just nitpicking.I prefer this byk for those who mind for fuel economy.That's all.\n",
      "My next-door-neighbour has purchased a Bajaj Byk and the following are my opinions about it:\n",
      " Styling and Finish\n",
      "Compact in size, the overall make-up, if you call it, of the vehicle is pretty good, and certainly chic as far as the segment of consumers the product targets- beginners in motorcycle riding. The two-tone colour scheme looks better on it, and to be very frank, it looks like a deflated Pulsar, or something! If I were to rate it in terms of the styling alone, I would give it 9 out of 10 (you never get full marks in art, babe!!!)\n",
      " Performance\n",
      "With a 92.2cc engine, you can't expect a race horse, but what you can though, is a short distance runner- a sudden burst of speed, dazzle for a second or so, and then everything seems to run ahead of you! The 6.4bhp@7000rpm, as it says it delivers, is power enough to thrill the kid as also to keep him and all his bones, teeth, et cetera safe! If the Byk has the beginner in view, it better be meek because otherwise, lots of mothers will begin swearing at Mr. Bajaj for giving a bloody race-horse in the hands of a monkey! The vehicle gets on to 60Km/hr in roughly 12 seconds which is all the time you'd have between two signals in an average Indian town. Advice- don't think of speed, think of studies, or, (OK, I'll give you that), your girlfriend (pay attention to the road, though). The performance is good with respect to the short-commuting the aimed-at consumer is expected to use it for. However, I would not recommend this for a highway ride.\n",
      " Mileage, economy\n",
      "At the showroom, if you have to pay not more than Rs 35,000 to get your hands on a motorcycle and thereby turn your friends' eyes green with envy (unless they're crashing CBZ's), then you'd want your dad to get it at that instant! Yes, very cheap as a purchase, it is also very-very good if you're running yourself on a pocket-money budget. You'd get something between 700 to 800 Km at least with every 10m litres which is very good and economical.\n",
      " Safety, stability, comfort\n",
      "Small and dainty in size, with a dry weight of 98Kg (yeah, it's a motorbike), the vehicle can't really boast of stability and comfort on rough roads like you'd find very often in India. It most certainly will be a jumping jack on the bad ones if the rider's beyond 40Km/hr, which makes it imperative the rider is slow and cautious. Of course, the vehicle is designed for a cautious and sensible user. The braking of this vehicle has got 4 out of 5 stars in the report of the roadtest on indiabike.com which means that it's safe to be ever so slightly liberal on speed. But, for sudden and panic stops, you'd really have to brace yourself, because the rear tends to shake a bit, a bit more, and a hell lot depending whether you're fast, faster or fastest. The gear changing is slick and very smooth. But if you go for too long, you'd be inviting a back ache, to be honest. The suspension is good, but smaller vehicles always tend to be more unstable and jumpy.\n",
      " Summing it all up\n",
      "The BYK is very-very economical in terms of price and fuel efficiency and therefore it will win the father's choice, surely. And if the kid is a bit sensible, he'd prefer to have a BYK than some Saffire (at least Byk's a motorcycle). Even the performance is not tremendous, it is good enough to give the young rider a taste of some motor-cycle medicine. Comfort levels aren't very high, but are good enough for somebody using it to go to his college, friend's place, gym or (OK, we'll have to say this), girlfriend's home. If, however, the buyer is looking for a long-distance vehicle, this is not a good choice.\n",
      "Thank you for reading,\n",
      "You're really patient.\n",
      "Hi\n",
      "i own a bajaj byk and I have 1st hand experience about its mileage. well I rushed in to the showroom after seeing the ads about the 100kmpl mileage and the first shock was the size of the bike. nevertheless I bought it but all my expectations about the mail went down the drainage... the bike before the first service (500km) gave an average mileage of 60kmpl but even after complaining about this to the showroom after the 1st service the mileage dropped to 44kmpl. I took the bike to the showroom at around 1200 kms on the odometer and got the bike fixed to give a mileage of about 55 to 65 kmpl. then during  the second service I wrote a long complaint letter and after which the company now assures me a minimum of 80 kmpl which I am yet to test it for my own. for sceptics who still applaud the maileage I have regularily maintained a excel worksheet containing fuel filling data which stands proof for the mileage. send me a mail and I will forward u the worksheet\n",

      "Bajaj Byk,as the name suggests the bike appers strikingly small at the first glance and the same again at any different angle. It is a beginner's bike,easy to learn and easy to ride. It comes with 4-stroke 92.1 cc engine which generates 6.41bhp@7000rpm and 6.9Nm@5500rpm(torque).Weighing only 98 kgs,the bike can be balanced,manouvered and thus handled by kids too.It is an entry level bike made for students exclusively coz it does not proves hard on the wallet,costing just 27,000 for the Lucknowites.Moreover it has an excellent mileage.This is a bike for people who want a vechile for their daily works. But hey guys,just in case u are a bike freak and a fan of speed I suggest u not to buy this bike.The reason being the vexing vibrations which one can start to have an encounter with after reaching upto the speeds of 50+.The bike completes 0-60km/hr in about 10.2 seconds which in quite slow;especially according to my view.\n",
      "The bike is also not meant for racing too as it would hamper and tamper the engine a lot.The bike reaches a top whack of 81.6 km/hr which the faulty speedometer reads 85. The only plus point of this bike is its fuel efficiency.The bike gives 70-80 km/l in normal city riding conditions.This mileage figure is expected to rise to 90+ when riding on highways which gives the bike a range of 800 kms with its 10 litred petrol tank. Still I would recommend Byk to persons seeking bikes of the boxer series coz they both are same with the former itching ahead of the latter one in terms of a few factors including styling and mileage.But whether one buys Byk or Boxer the winner will be Bajaj,only and thats the bottomline!\n",
