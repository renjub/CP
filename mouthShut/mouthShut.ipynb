      "Review: This bike “Byk” was designed for comman man keeping in mind about the mileage, but they forgot about all the other major things which make this bike ineligible in aspects of appearance as well as specifications. even though it has a 100 cubic capacity engine ( 92.2 to be exact) this byk does not even run uproads. while you are with the pillion rider the engine sounds as if you have a bunch of people seated together and the engine is struggling to make the bike move.\n",

      "Review: If talk as a look, really wonder full. Stylish byke. This is one of the best byke I have used. It is really a nice byke. If any one is going to purchase byke there is no one byke which is as good as bajaj. A person if ones use bajaj byke he can never thought to purchase any other byke expet bajaj. In bajaj all bykes are superb but pulsur is the best in my eyes. Even in my family there is only bajaj bykes. No one in my family want to use any other byke except babaj. Bajaj I love this barnd and I suggest to every one to purchase only bajaj because it is the best in all.\n",

This bike mileage is ok not so good it is giving 60 kms per liter and comfort for this is not so good if we travel long than definitely will need to suffer from back pain.\n",

      "Review: I have purchased many bikes of Bajaj Automobiles i.e. Bajaj Caliber, Bajaj Boxer then Bajaj BYK. After 2 months its machine got damaged. Then after facing of lac problems, company changed the machine. but that machine also damaged in 3 months. I faced many problem in this bike like average, balance, electrical problems etc. I thank that was my wrong decision and company make that model discontinue that days. I requesed to company for change my model with another one. But they gave me only verbal commitment. After lac of problem I decided to sold it. Then I sold that BYK in 10% amount........ Thats why nowadays I never buy the new launch of bikes and  I said never buy the BYK because its full mean is Buy Yourself to Kill (BYK).........

I didn't expect so much as all the advertiser mention a lot bit increased mileage intentionally. I thought if not 100 it could make at least 70. But alas after I purchased and tested and  it was very very dissapointed. It made a mere 54 to 58 kmpl. Its not fair. Advertisements should give a logical or closer declaration.\n",

      "Review: Bajaj Byk,as the name suggests the bike appers strikingly small at the first glance and the same again at any different angle. It is a beginner's bike,easy to learn and easy to ride. It comes with 4-stroke 92.1 cc engine which generates 6.41bhp@7000rpm and 6.9Nm@5500rpm(torque).Weighing only 98 kgs,the bike can be balanced,manouvered and thus handled by kids too.It is an entry level bike made for students exclusively coz it does not proves hard on the wallet,costing just 27,000 for the Lucknowites.Moreover it has an excellent mileage.This is a bike for people who want a vechile for their daily works. But hey guys,just in case u are a bike freak and a fan of speed I suggest u not to buy this bike.The reason being the vexing vibrations which one can start to have an encounter with after reaching upto the speeds of 50+.The bike completes 0-60km/hr in about 10.2 seconds which in quite slow;especially according to my view.\n",
